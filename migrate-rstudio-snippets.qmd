Code snippets let you insert ready-made templates for common coding patterns.
For example, `for` is a reserved word in R that is used to create a loop.
In actual usage, `for` is always part of a larger construct:

```r
for (variable in vector) {
    # code to repeat
}
```

A snippet for `for` inserts this whole skeleton, with special placeholders that let you use {{< kbd Tab >}} to move through the positions for `variable` and `vector`, and `# code to repeat`.

It is common for IDEs to provide explicit support for code snippets and this certainly holds true for both RStudio and Positron.
This guide is intended to help users who have used snippets in RStudio adapt their approach for Positron, which inherits snippet behavior from its Code OSS architecture.

Documentation on snippets in:

* [RStudio](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/productivity/snippets.html)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/userdefinedsnippets)

## Default and custom snippets in RStudio

RStudio ships with a default set of snippets.
For our purposes, it's useful to break them into two broad classes:

* Reserved words: These snippets relate to keywords that have special meaning. This includes control flow elements, such as `if`, `while`, and `for`, as well as the `function` keyword.
* Everything else: These snippets relate to a selection of functions, mostly in the so-called base packages. Examples include `matrix()`, the `apply()` family of functions, and various functions around S4 classes, such as `setClass()`.

You can customize your RStudio snippets via the *Edit Snippets* button in *Global Options > Code*.
Under the hood, this initializes a user-level snippet file that is pre-populated with RStudio's default snippets.
You can then apply your desired changes, such as adding or deleting snippets.
Going forward, this user-level file powers all of your RStudio snippets, i.e. there is no combining of built-in and user-level snippets.

## Default and custom snippets in Positron

The completion experience in Positron arises from two components working together:

* Positron: The IDE controls the overall completion experience, which is the heart of the so-called [IntelliSense features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/intellisense#_intellisense-features) in VS Code. IntelliSense provides the user interface for completions and is also in charge of combining/filtering/sorting completions coming from multiple sources, including snippets. These snippets can come from various sources:
  - Extensions
  - User settings
  - Workspace settings
* R language server: The [ark kernel](https://github.com/posit-dev/ark) provides an LSP server for R and, in particular, ark produces all (or almost all) of the completions you see for R.

This division of labor means that the completion and snippet responsibilities are a bit different in Positron than in RStudio.

### Reserved words

In Positron, the completion items related to R's reserved words are built into ark.
Each reserved word can be completed on its own and, in some cases, as part of a larger snippet.

### Everything else

If you want snippets beyond those provided for R's reserved words, you'll need to configure that for yourself.
Press {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-P win=Ctrl-Shift-P linux=Ctrl-Shift-P >}} to open the command palette and type *Snippets: Configure Snippets*.

Snippets can be stored in three types of files:

1. "Global": contains snippets that are not limited to one language. Create with *New Global Snippets file...*.
    - Individual snippets can have a `scope` which specifies one or more languages. Include `"r"` in the `scope` for any snippet you want to use in R.
    - This writes a `.code-snippets` file alongside your other Positron user settings. It is pre-populated with example snippets for both R and Python.
1. "Global" but for one workspace: contains snippets for multiple languages but tied to a specific workspace. Create with *New Snippets file for 'MyProject'*.
    - This writes a `.code-snippets` file alongside the other settings for the workspace, pre-populated with example snippets.

1. Language-specific: contains snippets for one specific language. Create by selecting the language from the drop-down menu, which includes entries for R, Python, and Quarto.

    In the case of R, this writes an `r.json` file alongside your other Positron user settings. It is pre-populated with an R example snippet.

Although both RStudio and Positron keep track of custom snippets in a file, they don't use the same syntax.
Positron uses the TextMate syntax, which is inherited from VS Code.
If you miss specific snippets from RStudio's defaults, you can consult this file to see what they look like when translated to the syntax used by Positron: [`r.code-snippets`](https://github.com/posit-dev/ark/blob/19337a1b41e8c5a3a77ac61db93b7c6bf6cdc8a3/crates/ark/resources/snippets/r.code-snippets).
