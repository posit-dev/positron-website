The **Connections** pane allows you to manage and explore database connections for use within your Python and/or R sessions. You can create connections to databases, explore their schemas, and interactively preview database tables.

## Explore your database schema

Once you [create a new connection](#create-a-new-connection), you can use the **Connections** pane to explore the database schema. 

![Connections pane showing database schema, tables, and columns](images/connections-pane-schema-explorer.png){fig-alt="Connections pane schema explorer displaying database tables with expandable columns showing data types like VARCHAR, INTEGER, and DOUBLE."}

You can navigate through the database schema, viewing tables, columns, and their data types. You can also select the table icon to explore a preview of the database contents in the [Data Explorer](data-explorer.qmd).

## Create a new connection 

You can create a new connection to a database either from the UI, or using Python or R code.

### Create a new connection from the UI

To open a new connection, select the **New connection** button in the **Connections** pane. This will open a modal that allows you to select the connection type and fill in the connection details. This modal generates the code required to open the connection in your Python or R session.

When you create a new connection, Positron stores and manages connection strings for future usage.

### Create a connection using R

To create a connection in the Positron **Connections** pane, you need to connect to a database using any
package that supports the connections contract, such as [odbc](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc), [sparklyr](https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr),
[bigrquery](https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery), and others.

The Positron **Connections** pane implements [RStudio's connections contract](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/connections-contract.html); this means that any package that works within RStudio's **Connections** pane should work within the Positron **Connections** pane.

Here is an example of how to open a connection using the [connections](https://github.com/rstudio/connections) package to open a SQLite connection:

``` r
con <- connections::connection_open(RSQLite::SQLite(), "nycflights13.sqlite")
```

Select the connection object [from the **Variables** pane](#explore-a-connection-from-the-variables-pane) or use `connections::connect_view(con)` to open the **Connections** pane.

You can find more information about connecting to a specific database [from Posit Solutions Engineering](https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/databases/).

### Create a connection using Python

Currently we support connections created using:

- [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org)
- [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/clients/python/overview)
- SQL Server via [pymssql](https://pymssql.readthedocs.io/) or [pyodbc](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc)
- [Databricks SQL Connector](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/python-sql-connector.html)
- [Snowflake Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector)
- [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/)
- [AWS Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/python-redshift-driver.html)

To open a connection in the **Connections** pane, create a top level object that represents the connection/engine.

``` python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("nycflights13.sqlite")
```

You can then either use `%connection_show conn` to open the connection in the **Connections** pane or [open it from the **Variables** pane](#explore-a-connection-from-the-variables-pane).

## Explore a connection from the Variables pane

You can open an existing connection that you created from Python or R from the [**Variables** pane](variables-pane.qmd):

![Variables pane showing a connection object](images/connections-pane-variables-pane.png){fig-alt="Variables pane showing a conn variable with sqlite3.Connection type and a database icon button highlighted with an orange circle."}

Select the database icon to bring up the **Connections** pane, allowing you to navigate the database.
