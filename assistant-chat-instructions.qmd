Custom instructions do not apply to code completions.

Positron Assistant supports both **automatic workspace instructions** and **custom instructions files** to tailor AI behavior to your project's needs.

## Automatic workspace instructions

Add project-wide custom instructions by creating one or more of these files in your workspace root directory:

- `agent.md`
- `agents.md`
- `positron.md`
- `claude.md`
- `gemini.md`
- `llms.txt`

Positron Assistant automatically appends the content from these files to all chat interactions. This allows you to:

- Add project-specific coding standards or conventions
- Include domain-specific terminology or context
- Define preferred libraries or frameworks for your project

Note that Positron Assistant does not guarantee the order in which it appends these files. Follow issue [#10571](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10571) for updates.

## Custom instructions files

Create `.instructions.md` files that specify [glob patterns](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/glob-patterns) for when the instructions should apply.

Positron Assistant automatically uses these instructions when you work with files that match the specified patterns. This allows you to:

- Enforce coding standards for specific file types (e.g., `*.py` for Python scripts)
- Provide context-specific guidelines for different parts of your project (e.g., `src/data/**/*` for data processing scripts)
- Apply instructions workspace-wide using broad patterns (e.g., `**/*` for all files)

### Creating and managing custom instructions files

1. Run the command _Chat: New Instructions File..._ and follow the prompts to create a new instructions file
1. Edit the newly created `.instructions.md` file to specify the `applyTo` file glob pattern and the instructions you want to apply
1. To manage existing files, run the command _Chat: Configure Instructions..._
