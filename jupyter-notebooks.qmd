[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html) offer a flexible, interactive UI for combining code, prose, and visualizations.

Positron enhances Jupyter Notebooks in several key ways:

-   Notebooks work out of the box. You don't need to install any additional dependencies into your Python or R environments.
-   Notebooks are integrated into the IDE, allowing you to manage data sources in the [Connections Pane](connections-pane.qmd), view data at a glance in the Variables Pane, explore data in depth with the [Data Explorer](data-explorer.qmd), and browse documentation in the [Help Pane](help-pane.qmd).
-   Language features such as autocompletion and go-to-definition work seamlessly across notebooks and plaintext files.

## Notebook Editors

Positron offers two editors for working with Jupyter Notebooks:

- Positron Notebook Editor (Alpha)
- Legacy Notebook Editor

### Positron Notebook Editor 

The [Positron Notebook Editor](positron-notebook-editor.qmd) is a native notebook experience built specifically for Positron. It provides notebook-aware AI assistance, integrated data exploration, and an improved user experience for data science workflows.

To enable the **Positron Notebook Editor**, see the [setup instructions](positron-notebook-editor.qmd#enable-the-positron-notebook-editor).

### Legacy Notebook Editor

The [Legacy Notebook Editor](legacy-notebook-editor.qmd) is based on the VS Code notebook editor. If you're familiar with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code, this editor will feel familiar.
