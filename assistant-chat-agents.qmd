::: {.callout-note}
Chat agents were previously called chat modes.
:::

Chat agents tailor Assistant's behavior for specific tasks by providing unique instructions and tools. Click the agent selector dropdown at the bottom of the chat pane to switch between agents.

It's also possible to create [custom chat agents](#custom-chat-agents) to suit your specific workflows and requirements.

## Default chat agents

- **Ask**: Provides answers and code suggestions without automatic execution
- **Edit**: Suggests code changes for you to apply to files
- **Agent**: Autonomously executes work including running code and modifying files
- **Plan**: Creates detailed step-by-step plans before execution

| Agent | Description | Example Prompts |
| -- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **Ask** | Provides answers to questions, helps with debugging, and generates code suggestions.<br><br>The Ask agent offers code you can apply in your Editor or run in the Console, but it will not edit or run code automatically. | "How do I plot a histogram in Python?"<br><br>"Why am I getting a syntax error in my R script?"<br><br>"Can you explain what this function does?" |
| **Edit** | Suggests code changes based on your prompts that you can apply to your files.<br><br>The Edit agent helps you modify existing code but requires your approval for each change. | "Refactor this function to improve readability."<br><br>"Convert this R code to Python."<br><br>"Add error handling to this script." |
| **Agent** | Determines the steps needed for your request and autonomously carries out the work.<br><br>The Agent can execute code in the Console, create and modify files, and identify next steps based on previous results. | "Create a new Python file and set up a basic data analysis workflow."<br><br>"Install the required packages and run the code in the Console."<br><br>"Generate a summary report from my current dataset." |
| **Plan** | Creates a step-by-step plan to accomplish your request.<br><br>The Plan agent retrieves relevant context and develops a detailed plan, which it presents for your review before proceeding with execution. | "Outline the steps needed to analyze a dataset and generate visualizations."<br><br>"Plan how to test and debug this R script."<br><br>"Create a plan to display my data in an interactive Shiny app." |

## Custom chat agents

Adding custom chat agents allows you to:

- Create specialized agents for specific tasks or workflows
- Tailor the Positron Assistant's behavior and available tools for different use cases

### Create a custom chat agent

1. Run the command _Chat: New Custom Agent..._ and follow the prompts to create a new chat agent file.
1. Edit the newly created `.agent.md` file to specify the chat agent `description`, the `tools` the chat agent can use, as well as the chat agent prompt content.
1. Once you have created a custom chat agent, it will be available in the agent selector dropdown in the chat pane.

::: {.callout-tip}
To learn more about the format of custom agents, see the following VS Code documentation:

- [Custom agent file structure](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents#_custom-agent-file-structure)  
- [Custom agents in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents)

*Note:* Positron Assistant does not support the `model` field at this time.

### Example custom chat agent
Below is a custom chat agent that is tailored to developing Shiny apps. The definition contains rules, direction, and clarification that the agent will follow when invoked with Positron Assistant which guide its responses to be more relevant to Shiny development specifically.

# Shiny Development Assistant

You are a Shiny app development specialist. Your role is to help users create, debug, and enhance interactive web applications using Shiny for R or Python (Shiny for Python).

## Your expertise includes:

* **App Structure**: Create well-organized Shiny apps with clear separation between UI and server logic
* **Reactive Programming**: Implement reactive expressions, observers, and event handlers correctly
* **UI Components**: Use appropriate input widgets, output displays, and layout functions
* **Interactivity**: Connect user inputs to outputs through reactive dependencies
* **Best Practices**: Follow Shiny conventions for performance, modularity, and maintainability

## When helping users:

1. **Determine the framework**: Ask whether the user is working with Shiny for R or Shiny for Python if not clear from context
2. **Understand requirements**: Clarify what the app should do, what inputs it needs, and what outputs it should display
3. **Provide complete code**: Generate working Shiny app code with both UI and server components
4. **Explain reactivity**: When implementing reactive logic, explain how data flows through the app
5. **Suggest improvements**: Recommend modules, error handling, or performance optimizations when appropriate

## Code organization:

- For simple apps: Provide single-file app.R (R) or app.py (Python) structure
- For complex apps: Suggest multi-file structure with separate UI, server, and module files
- Include necessary library imports and dependencies

## Common tasks you excel at:

- Creating new Shiny apps from scratch
- Adding interactive visualizations (plots, tables, maps)
- Implementing file uploads and downloads
- Building dynamic UIs that change based on user input
- Debugging reactivity issues and infinite loops
- Optimizing app performance with reactive caching

## Rules
- Always output complete code that can be run directly.
- Write directly to a file when asked to create or modify code, instead of just providing snippets.
- If the user requests to run the app, hand off to the "Run App" agent.

```

**Tools**  
The agent is restricted to tools relating to `search` and `edit` functionality, limiting the number of "decisions" Positron Assistant must make while working. For example, you may grant a data analysis agent access to the `getPlot` tool to inspect Positron's plot output, whereas a Shiny development agent has no need to view plots. 

**Handoffs**  
This agent provides a handoff, which gives users a way to trigger a subsequent action with one click. A user will naturally run a Shiny app after it's written, so this handoff presents the user with a button titled "Run App" which instructs Assistant to spin up the newly created Shiny app. An agent can provide as few or many handoffs as makes sense for its use case.
