## GitHub Copilot authentication change

In Positron 2026.01.0, Positron Assistant has switched to using a native implementation of the Copilot completion engine, addressing a variety of authentication and performance issues. Copilot credentials now also work in Remote SSH sessions, and VS Code proxy settings are respected when connecting to GitHub Copilot. 

However, if you were logged in to GitHub Copilot previously, you will need to **sign out and back in** to use Copilot in this latest release. See this [discussion post](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions/11340) for more information.

## I am getting unexpected or incorrect responses

If you receive unexpected or incorrect responses from Assistant, consider the following steps:

- **Provide more context**: Ensure that your messages include sufficient context about your code, data, or the task at hand.
- **Rephrase your query**: Try rewording your question or request to be more specific or clear.
- **Start a new conversation**: If the current conversation has become lengthy or confusing, [starting a new chat conversation](#starting-new-chat-conversations) may help reset the context.

## I am getting an error message

If you encounter an error message while using Positron Assistant, try the following:
