title: "Updating Positron"
---

By default, Positron automatically checks for updates from our channel of monthly releases.

- On Windows and Mac, if an update is available, Positron will download it and install the new version in the background.
- On Linux, Positron will show a notification when an update is available.

You can opt out of this automatic checking by changing the [`update.mode` setting](positron://settings/update.mode) to `"none"`; see [our page on privacy and data collection](privacy.qmd) for more details.

## Daily builds

For users who are interested in trying out new features at a faster cadence, we also provide a channel of daily builds; you can opt in to these builds by changing the [`update.positron.channel` setting](positron://settings/update.positron.channel) to `"dailies"`.

If you change the setting to `"dailies"`, what can you expect? 

- You will have an updated version of Positron available most days (instead of once a month). You'll see a notification in the bottom left prompting you to restart.
- These daily builds only go through automated testing before being made available, not our full QA process. If you consider yourself an adventurous early adopter, this may be a good fit for you!
- If some daily build happens to be entirely broken for you, the best step for you to take is to close Positron and [install the latest monthly release](download.qmd).

## Windows package managers

We don't yet officially maintain Positron on Windows package managers, but you can install the latest version of Positron via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) thanks to the efforts of community maintainers.

### Scoop Package Manager

```

This bucket is managed by [Christophe Dervieux](https://github.com/cderv/r-bucket#positron).
