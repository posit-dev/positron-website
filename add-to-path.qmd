title: "Launch Positron from a Terminal"
---

If Positron is on your PATH, you can launch it from the terminal:

- Type `positron .` to open Positron in the current folder, _or_
- `positron foo` to open Positron in a custom folder of your choice.

See the instructions below on how to add Positron to your PATH based on operating system.

### macOS

After you have installed Positron, you can add it to your PATH via the Command Palette. Press {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-P win=Ctrl-Shift-P linux=Ctrl-Shift-P >}} to open the palette and type *Install 'positron' command in PATH*.

After you have executed this command once, Positron is added to your PATH. Restart your terminal to pick up the changes to your PATH.

### Windows

Positron installers on Windows include an option to add a `positron` command to your PATH. This installation option is selected by default.

If you had cleared this option during installation, you can manually add the `bin` folder of your Positron installation to your PATH. For a System level installation, this folder is located at `C:\Program Files\Positron\bin` by default. For a User level installation, this folder is located at `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Positron\bin` by default. You will need to restart your terminal after updating your PATH.

Once Positron is on your PATH, you can use a terminal to launch Positron.
