## Loved by Data Scientists
See what the community is saying about Positron

> *"Positron feels like stepping into the future of data science. I work in both R and Python daily, and switching between projects has never been easier. With built-in version control, a lightning-fast data explorer, and automatic code formatting, my workflow is pure joy — building apps, packages, reports, or teaching materials has never felt this seamless."* - **Christoph Scheuch**, Tidy Intelligence - Founder


> *"I've always loved RStudio for its powerful data science features, but I often wished it had the flexibility of VS Code. Positron delivers exactly that, all right out of the box. AND it has made it easy to start learning and upskilling with Python. It's the perfect environment for modern data science"* - **Jenna Eagleson**, People Analytics at Regal Rexnord - Manager
