::: {.callout-important} 
The Positron Notebook Editor is currently in public alpha. Read [the launch blog post](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-positron-notebook-editor-for-jupyter-notebooks/) for more details. We are actively working on improving the Notebook experience in Positron and want to hear from you! Share your thoughts on [this Github discussion](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions/10047) or [schedule a call](https://scheduler.zoom.us/cindy-tong/improving-the-positron-notebook-experience) with our product and engineering team.

The Positron Notebook Editor provides a familiar notebook experience for Jupyter (`.ipynb`) files. IDE features work out of the box in notebooks, including AI assistance, data exploration, and debugging.

## Key features

- **Batteries-included experience**: No extensions required for core features
- **Improved user experience**: Optimized for data science workflows
- **Notebook-aware AI assistance**: AI understands your notebook context, execution history, and execution order
- **Integrated data exploration**: Variables Pane and Data Explorer work seamlessly
- **Debugging**: Works out of the box without additional setup

## Enable the Positron Notebook Editor

To make the Positron Notebook Editor the default Jupyter Notebook editor, enable the [`positron.notebook.enabled`](positron://settings/positron.notebook.enabled) setting.

## Getting started

You can create and edit `.ipynb` files in Positron just as you would in other editors. To learn how to use the Positron Notebook Editor, check out our [demo notebook](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron-demos-notebooks/).

### Notebook layout

For the best experience, open the Command Palette with {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-P win=Ctrl-Shift-P linux=Ctrl-Shift-P >}} and run the _View: Notebook Layout_ command. This layout arranges the IDE panes into a notebook friendly setup, giving you quick access to your variables, plots, and other data science tools alongside your notebook.

To learn more about customizing the Positron interface, read the [Layout](layout.qmd) documentation.

### Setting up your environment

Positron comes bundled with Jupyter kernel support for R and Python. Once you've [configured a Python or R environment](managing-interpreters.qmd) for Positron, you do not need to install any additional dependencies into your environment before using a notebook.

If an environment installed on your computer isn't available in Positron, you may want to read more about how Positron discovers [Python installations](python-installations.qmd) and [R installations](r-installations.qmd).

You can manually select a different interpreter for the notebook by selecting the **Kernel Selector** in the notebook editor action bar. The **Change Kernel...** option will display a list of all the registered interpreters. Select an interpreter from the list. 

Alternatively, you can run the *Positron Notebook: Change Kernel...* command from the Command Palette.

## Positron Assistant integration

The Positron Notebook Editor integrates with [Positron Assistant](assistant.qmd) to provide notebook-aware AI assistance:

- **Context-Aware**: Assistant has access to rich context about your notebook, including cell states, execution history, code and outputs including images and tables.
- **Dynamic Suggestions**: Assistant follows your work and dynamically suggests actions to improve your notebook.
- **Actionable Editing**: With your permission, Assistant can directly edit and run cells in your notebook.
- **Transparent**: You can inspect and control the specific context the Assistant is using.
- **Collaborative**: Use [Follow Assistant](#follow-assistant) to automatically scroll and highlight cells as they're edited

### Enable Positron Assistant

To use the integrated notebook AI features, you will need to set up Positron Assistant. See [Getting Started with Positron Assistant](assistant-getting-started.qmd) for setup instructions. Currently, we recommend using Anthropic as a model provider for the best experience.

Once enabled, you will see assistant specific actions in the notebook editor action bar.

### Notebook Assistant panel

The Notebook Assistant panel provides a quick way to interact with Assistant directly from your notebook. To open it, click the **Assistant** icon button in the notebook editor action bar.

From the panel, you can:

- **View context**: See which cells are included in the Assistant context
- **Quick actions**: Run common actions like explaining the contents of a notebook or fixing errors in a notebook
- **Generate suggestions**: View dynamically generated suggestions based on the current state of the notebook

Selecting an option from the panel will open a new [Chat Pane](assistant-chat.qmd) with the notebook context already attached.

### Follow assistant

When the Assistant is actively editing cells in your notebook, you may want to watch its progress. Click **Follow Assistant** in the notebook editor action bar to have the notebook automatically scroll to cells as they are edited. This lets you review changes in real-time.
