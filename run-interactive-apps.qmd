title: "Run Interactive Apps"
---

Positron provides a simplified method for running interactive apps via the **Play** button in the **Editor Actions** area. Instead of running an app from a **Terminal**, you can run supported apps by clicking the **Play** button. You can also start a supported app in debug mode through the **Play** button context menu.

## Debugging an interactive app

1. Open the `.py` file of a supported app framework.
2. Set breakpoints in the `.py` file by clicking on the editor margin.

3. Open the context menu for the **Play** button and select **Debug [*{SUPPORTED_APP_TYPE}*] App in Terminal**.
    - *{SUPPORTED_APP_TYPE}* is one of the supported app frameworks, which is *Streamlit* in this example.

4. Positron runs the app in a dedicated **Terminal** tab, opens the app URL in the **Viewer** pane, and starts the app in debug mode.
