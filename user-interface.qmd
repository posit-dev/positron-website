## User interface

Positron's interface is designed to provide a flexible and efficient environment for data science. By organizing various tools and outputs into distinct, customizable panes, you can tailor your development environment to suit your workflows in Python, R, and more.

## Basic overview

> This section outlines the core layout elements of Positron’s interface. Each pane plays a distinct role in supporting coding, data exploration, and model development, giving you full control over your data science environment.

*Labeled interface diagram of the Positron development environment.*

- **Title bar**: Located at the top, it shows the active file (_e.g.,_ `ui.rs`) and project (_e.g.,_ `ark`) along with window controls.
- **Top bar**: Provides global project tools such as file search, and lets you change interpreter versions (e.g., `Python`, `R`).
- **Primary sidebar**: Found on the left, this pane contains the File Explorer to navigate the project directory.
- **Central editor area**: The main region for editing files. Supports syntax highlighting, inline diagnostics, code folding, and navigation tools.
- **Secondary sidebar**: The right panel, useful for interacting with runtimes. Contains tabs like `SESSION`, `CONNECTIONS`, `HELP`, `VIEWER`, `VARIABLES`, and `PLOTS`.
- **Status bar**: Displays project details like Git branch, language mode, and cursor position.

## Editor pane

In the upper central area by default, the editor is where you write, debug, and refine your code. Whether in Python or R, the editor delivers a full-featured IDE experience tailored to data science workflows.

- Write and edit scripts, notebooks, and apps with responsive syntax-aware features.
- Built on VS Code foundations for a familiar and extensible experience.
- For layout controls, refer to [VS Code Editor Basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/basics).

### Key features
- **Syntax Highlighting**  
  Intelligent color schemes for quick visual parsing of R, Python, Rust, YAML, and more.
- **Auto completion & Intellisense**  
  Language server support for live suggestions, signature help, and hover tooltips.
- **Inline Diagnostics**  
  Errors, warnings, and linter messages appear in context as you type.
- **Multi-language Support**  
  Work seamlessly across Python, R, Quarto, Shiny, and Markdown files. No additional configuration needed.
- **Live Document Preview**  
  Render R Markdown, Quarto documents, Shiny apps, and more next to your code for immediate feedback.
- **Tabs and Split View**  
  Organize workspaces with multiple tabs or horizontal/vertical splits to suit your workflow.
- **Version Control Integration**  
  View diffs, stage changes, and commit directly within the editor.

## Panel pane

The panel below the editor offers contextual tools essential for development and debugging.

### Terminal

- Fully integrated shell for script execution, CLI tools, and environment management.
- Multiple terminals supported and session-specific tabs available.

### Other panel tabs

- **Console**: Displays Python/R runtime output.
- **Output**: Logs from builds, publishing, or package management.
- **Problems**: Lists code issues with quick navigation.
- **Ports**: Manage forwarded ports for interactive apps like Shiny or Flask.

## Layout customization

Positron offers flexible layout options to suit a variety of development workflows.

### Layout options

- **Stacked** (default): Editor above, with **Console**, **Viewer**, and **Plots/Environment** below. Designed for traditional script-based workflows.
- **Side-by-side**: Useful for wide-screen users or those who prefer horizontal splitting.
- **Notebook style**: Output appears below code blocks, like in Jupyter or R Notebooks.

### Reset options

- Right-click a pane → _Reset location_
- Use preset menu → _Reset to factory settings_
