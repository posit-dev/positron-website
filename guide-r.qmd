Positron ships with first class support for R, along with [Python](guide-python.qmd). Start with our guide on how Positron [discovers and manages R installations](r-installations.qmd), then read on for details on working with R code in Positron.

## Settings

:::{.callout-tip}
If you'd prefer to customize Positron to feel similar to RStudio, learn [what settings to consider](migrate-rstudio-settings-and-extensions.qmd#settings-for-rstudio-users).
:::

Positron provides setting defaults for working with R, but you can override or change these defaults if you prefer a different experience. For example, Positron sets the tab size for R code to 2 spaces, but if you prefer 4 spaces, you can change the [`editor.tabSize`](positron://settings/editor.tabSize) setting for R files by adding the following to your user or workspace `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "[r]":  {
      "editor.tabSize": 4
    }
}
```

You can see _all_ the setting defaults that Positron provides with the command _Preferences: Open Default Settings (JSON)_.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The keyboard shortcuts in Positron are largely a superset of the keyboard shortcuts used by Visual Studio Code, plus additional [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.qmd) specific to Positron's data science features. Some of those additional shortcuts are specific to R programming:

| Shortcut | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-M win=Ctrl-Shift-M linux=Ctrl-Shift-M >}} | Insert the pipe operator (<code>&#124;></code> or `%>%`)[^1] | 
| {{< kbd mac=Option-- win=Alt-- linux=Alt-- >}} | Insert the assignment operator (`<-`) |
| {{< kbd mac=Command-K win=Ctrl-K linux=Ctrl-K >}}, {{< kbd H >}} | Insert section |
| {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-L win=Ctrl-Shift-L linux=Ctrl-Shift-L >}} | Load the current R package, if any, with `devtools::load_all()` | 
| {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-B win=Ctrl-Shift-B linux=Ctrl-Shift-B >}} | Build and install the current R package, if any | 
| {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-T win=Ctrl-Shift-T linux=Ctrl-Shift-T >}} | Test the current R package, if any | 
| {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-E win=Ctrl-Shift-E linux=Ctrl-Shift-E >}} | Check the current R package, if any | 
| {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-D win=Ctrl-Shift-D linux=Ctrl-Shift-D >}} | Document the current R package, if any | 

:::{.callout-tip}
If you'd prefer to use keybindings as similar as possible to RStudio, learn [how to enable them](migrate-rstudio-keybindings.qmd) in Positron. This will overwrite some of Positron's default keybindings, but will provide a more familiar experience for RStudio users.
:::

You can create [custom keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.qmd#custom-shortcuts) as well.

[^1]: You can choose which pipe operator to insert via the [`positron.r.pipe`](positron://settings/positron.r.pipe) setting.

## Debugging

Breakpoints let you pause R code at specific lines so you can inspect variables and step through execution.

### Setting breakpoints in the editor

To set a breakpoint, click in the gutter to the left of a line number. A gray dot appears, indicating the breakpoint is set but not yet active.

To activate a breakpoint, you need to run the code:

- **In scripts**: Either evaluate the code with {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Enter win=Ctrl-Enter linux=Ctrl-Enter >}}, or source the file. Evaluating has the advantage that you do not need to run the entire script from the start and reset any state.

- **In packages**: Call `devtools::load_all()` to load the package with breakpoints enabled. This requires a recent version of pkgload. If breakpoints do not activate, install the latest version.

The dot turns red once the breakpoint is active. Positron may also adjust breakpoints to valid locations. For example, a breakpoint inside a multi-line expression moves to the first line of that expression.

When R reaches an active breakpoint, it pauses execution and opens the debugger. You can then inspect variables, step through code line by line using the debug toolbar, or continue running.

See the [VS Code documentation on breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_breakpoints) for more ways to manage breakpoints.

:::{.callout-tip}
In scripts, if you evaluate code that immediately reaches a breakpoint, such as a `for` loop or `lapply()` call, the breakpoint activates and triggers in one step.
:::

#### Why is my breakpoint gray?

A gray dot means the breakpoint is not yet active. This happens when:

- **You have not run the code yet.** Evaluate or source the code to activate the breakpoint.
- **You edited the file.** Editing invalidates all breakpoints in that file to prevent stepping through a stale view of the code. Run the code again to reactivate them.
- **The breakpoint is in an invalid location.** If the breakpoint remains gray after sourcing or evaluating, it is in an invalid location. For instance, breakpoints on closing braces `}` cannot be hit. Hover over the dot to see the reason.

#### Differences with RStudio

If you are coming from RStudio, note these differences:

- You do not need to source files. Evaluating code is enough.
- Breakpoints work everywhere, including R6 methods.
- In packages, breakpoints do not activate automatically. In RStudio, you can run `load_all()` once and breakpoints update automatically thereafter. In Positron, you need to call `load_all()` again to activate new breakpoints.

#### Differences with other debuggers

If you are coming from debuggers in other languages, note these differences:

- **Step Out** (`f`) finishes the current loop or function rather than returning to the caller.
- **Editing a file invalidates all breakpoints** in that file immediately, even if the breakpoint line did not change. This prevents stepping through a stale view of the code.

## Classic R debugging

Familiar R debugging workflows are well integrated in Positron. You can insert `browser()` directly in your code to pause execution at that point. Other useful functions include `debug(fn)` to step through every call to a function, or `debugonce(fn)` for a single call.

Once in the debugger, you can type debug commands as an alternative to using the debug toolbar: `n` (Step Over), `s` (Step Into), `f` (Step Out), `c` (Continue), or `Q` (Disconnect).
