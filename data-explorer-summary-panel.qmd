title: "Summary Panel"
description: "View summary statistics, sparklines, and missing data for each column."
---

The summary panel displays a vertical scrolling list of all of the column names
and an icon representing their respective type. It displays a sparkline
histogram or frequency table of that column's data, and also displays the amount
of missing data as both an inline bar graph and an increasing percentage. If you
click on the carat symbol for a column, it will expand to show additional
summary statistics and a larger sparkline.

Depending on the size of the dataset, when first opening
the Data Explorer or using its features (like scrolling, filtering, or sorting),
you may see loading indicators in the summary pane and in the bottom left corner
of the window:

There is a graph of arrival delays showing a right skew. Summary statistics are displayed: 8,824 missing, -86 min, -5 median, 6.96 mean, 1,127 max, 44.98 SD."}

The summary sparkline charts and missing data indicator display tooltips when
hovered over:

Tooltips in the Data Explorer Summary Panel
:::

If you hover over the data type indicator next to the column name, you will see
a tooltip showing the name of the column's data type:

![Data Explorer Summary Data Type Tooltip](images/data-explorer-summary-data-type-tooltip.png){width=300 fig-alt="Histogram showing data for air_time"is highlighted, with a tooltip displaying a range of 121.3 to 129.7 and count of 13,239 (4.0%)."}

Double clicking on a column name will also bring the column into focus in the
data grid, allowing for quickly navigating wider data.

1. The summary panel can be collapsed by dragging the grid and summary panel
   divider to the edge or by clicking on the collapse button after hovering over
   the divider. 

2. The summary panel can also be placed on the left or right side of the Data
   Explorer via the Layout control.

The boundary between summary panel and data grid is highlighted, with a box around an arrow button pointing towards the summary panel. Layout options are highlighted."}
