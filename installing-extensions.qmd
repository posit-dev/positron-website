title: Installing Extensions
---


Positron comes with all the extensions needed to start using Python or R already included. 
You can install other extensions from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/)-â€”an open-source registry for VS Code extensions.
While many extensions from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace are available on Open VSX, not all are. 
Availability depends on whether the extension author has published it to Open VSX.

To learn how to browse for and install extensions, refer to the [Visual Studio Code extension marketplace guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace#_browse-for-extensions). 
The installation experience in Positron is the same as in VS Code.
