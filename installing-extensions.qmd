title: Installling Extensions
---


By default, Positron comes with all the extensions needed to start coding in Python or R. 
You can install other extensions from the [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/), which is an open source registry for VSCode extensions.
Many, but not all, extensions available in the Visual Code Marketplace are available via Open VSX.
The availability is based on the extension author publishing to Open VSX.

To find out how to install extensions, you can visit the [Visual Studio Code extension marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace#_browse-for-extensions) documentation, as the experience is identical.
