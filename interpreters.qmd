Positron is designed to support multiple R and Python interpreter sessions. This enables workflows that span multiple environments, and allows you to switch between them easily within a single workspace.

At any given time, one interpreter session is designated as the **active interpreter session**. This is the language environment currently in use for interactive and language-specific features within the IDE.

Interpreter sessions are managed primarily through the Interpreter picker and Console pane which is covered in detail in the sections below.

## Interpreter Startup and Configuration

See the [Interpreter startup](interpreter-startup.qmd) guide for information on how Positron handles interpreter startup for you.

## Active interpreter session

The active interpreter session is the language environment currently in use. It provides the execution context for various panes within the IDE such as the Console, Variables, Plots, and Editor pane. Language-specific features such as code execution, completion, and diagnostics are all scoped to the active interpreter session.

The name of the active interpreter session is displayed on the Interpreter picker and in the tab view of the Console pane when there are multiple running interpreter session.

## Delete an interpreter session

When you delete an interpreter session, the state of the session will be lost, including any variables you've defined.

## Restart an interpreter session

When you restart an interpreter session, the session and variables state is cleared.

To restart the active interpreter session, click the Restart icon button in the Console action bar. 

## Rename an interpreter session

Renaming interpreter sessions is a useful tool to distinguish sessions for the same interpreter version.

To rename an interpreter session, open the Console pane to view the list of running session. Right-click the tab for the interpreter session you want to rename. Select the "Rename..." option from the context menu.

## View interpreter session metadata

To see information about the active interpreter session, click the Info icon button in the Console action bar. 
This shows a popup with information including shortcuts to the output channels for the active interpreter session.

## Interpreter session status

When there is more than one running interpreter session, the Console pane list view displays the status of each interpreter session. The list view displays an icon that indicates the session state.

An interpreter session can be in one of the following states:
* **Idle**: The interpreter session is available to run code.
* **Busy**:: The console session is busy with a task.
* **Shutdown**: The console session has shutdown.

Certain actions, such as a restart, display a progress indicator in the Console.
