## Anatomy of an Action Bar

### Regions

An Action Bar is divided into three regions: Left, Center, and Right. Every Action Bar includes the Left and Right regions, while the Center region appears only when needed. The most important actions are typically placed on the Left.

## Top Action Bar

The Top Action Bar helps you manage your work. On the left, you’ll find actions to create or open files and folders. In the center, you can navigate backward and forward through recent cursor positions and use the command center to quickly access Positron commands or locate files in your project. On the right, the interpreter selector lets you start new interpreters or switch between running ones, while the folder selector allows you to open recently used folders, either in the current window or a new one.
