The filter bar provides controls to:

- **Add Filter**: Create new filters for your data
- **Show/Hide Filters**: Toggle filter visibility 
- **Clear Filters**: Remove all applied filters
- **Convert to Code**: Generate reusable code from your current filters

The status bar at the bottom displays the percentage and number of remaining rows after you apply filters for the main data grid.

Options visible include 'Add Filter', 'Hide Filters', 'Clear Filters', 'Clear Column Sorting', and 'Convert to Code'. A summary below indicates a large data set."}

## Add filters

To create a new filter:

1. Select **Add Filter** from the **Manage Filter** dropdown or the {{<fa plus>}} button in the filter bar
2. Select a column from the list
3. Choose from the available filter options for that column type
4. Configure the filter parameters

You can also create filters directly from the data grid by right-clicking a column and selecting **Add Filter** from the context menu. This method pre-populates the column name.

### Filter types by column

Available filters depend on the column data type:

**String columns:**
- Contains
- Starts with or ends with  
- Is empty
- Exact matches

**Numeric columns:**
- Less than or greater than
- Equal to
- Between two values (inclusive)

For sorting capabilities, see the [Data Grid](data-explorer-data-grid.qmd) documentation.

## Show or hide filters

To toggle filter visibility, select **Show Filters** or **Hide Filters** from the **Manage Filter** dropdown. 

When filters are hidden, the data remains filtered. Only the filter controls are hidden from view. Hiding filters provides more screen space to view your data.

## Clear filters

To remove all applied filters, select **Clear Filters** from the **Manage Filter** dropdown. All filters are removed and the data returns to its original state. You can remove individual filters by clicking the {{<fa x>}} button on each filter control.

The Data Explorer includes a **Convert to Code** button in the top action bar. 
This button writes Python or R code that reproduces your current data view, including any filters or sorts you've applied during exploration.
This allows you to quickly capture your interactive exploration as reproducible code.
To convert your Data Explorer view to code:

1. Apply any filters, sorts, or other transformations in the Data Explorer
2. Click the **Convert to Code** button in the top action bar
3. Preview the code in the modal
4. Click **Copy to Clipboard** to copy the code for pasting into the console, a script, or any other location

The code references the dataframe object already loaded in your session rather than reading data from disk.
The **Convert to Code** button writes code appropriate for your dataframe type:

- pandas dataframes produce pandas code
- polars dataframes produce polars code, with the option to convert to pandas code
- R dataframes and tibbles produce dplyr code with pipe syntax
- Files opened directly (`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.parquet`) produce DuckDB SQL code
