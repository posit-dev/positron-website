The filter bar has controls to:

1. Add, Show/Hide existing filters, or Clear Filters
2. A {{<fa plus>}} button to quickly add a new filter
3. Convert currently applied filters to reusable code
4. The status bar at the bottom of the Data Explorer also displays the
   percentage and number of remaining rows relative to the original total after
   applying a filter

## Filtering

When creating a new filter, you will first need to select a column either by
scrolling the full list or searching across columns for a specific string. Once
a column is selected, the available filters for that column type will be
displayed. Alternatively, the context menu in each column label of the data grid
also allows for creating filters with the column name pre-populated.

Available filters vary according to the column type. For example, string columns
have filter affordances for: contains, starts or ends with, is empty, or exact
matches. Alternatively, numeric columns have logical operations such as: is less
than or greater than, is equal to, or is inclusively between two values.

There is also sorting capabilities, covered in the [Data Grid](data-explorer-data-grid.qmd).
