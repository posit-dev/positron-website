## Filtering

The filter bar has controls to:

1. Add, Show/Hide existing filters, or Clear Filters
2. A {{<fa plus>}} button to quickly add a new filter
3. The status bar at the bottom of the Data Explorer also displays the
   percentage and number of remaining rows relative to the original total after
   applying a filter

When creating a new filter, you will first need to select a column either by
scrolling the full list or searching across columns for a specific string. Once
a column is selected, the available filters for that column type will be
displayed. Alternatively, the context menu in each column label of the data grid
also allows for creating filters with the column name pre-populated.

Available filters vary according to the column type. For example, string columns
have filter affordances for: contains, starts or ends with, is empty, or exact
matches. Alternatively, numeric columns have logical operations such as: is less
than or greater than, is equal to, or is inclusively between two values.

## Sorting

To sort the data by a column's values, open a column's context menu from the top
of the grid and click either "Sort Ascending" or "Sort Descending":

To clear an individual column's sort, click on the column header and select
"Clear Sorting" from the context menu.

When a column is sorted, the column header will have an arrow pointing up or
down indicating the sort direction. You can sort by multiple columns by opening
the context menu for a second column and sorting it, too. The number next to the
sort direction indicates the sort order of the column.

A Data Explorer can be sorted and filtered at the same time without any issues.

To clear all sorting, click on the "Clear Column Sorting" button in the top
action bar:
