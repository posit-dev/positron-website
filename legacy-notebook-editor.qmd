You can create and edit `.ipynb` files in Positron just as you would in other editors.

For a general introduction to working with Jupyter Notebooks, see the [VS Code Jupyter Notebooks documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

### Setting up your environment

Positron comes bundled with Jupyter kernel support for R and Python. Once you've [configured a Python or R environment](managing-interpreters.qmd) for Positron, you do not need to install any additional dependencies into your environment before using a notebook.

If an environment installed on your computer isn't available in Positron, you may want to read more about how Positron discovers [Python installations](python-installations.qmd) and [R installations](r-installations.qmd).

You can manually select a different interpreter for the notebook by clicking the **Kernel Selector** button in the notebook editor action bar or by running the *Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel* command from the Command Palette.
