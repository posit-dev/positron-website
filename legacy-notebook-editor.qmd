You can create and edit `.ipynb` files in Positron just as you would in other editors. 

For a general introduction to working with Jupyter Notebooks, see the [VS Code Jupyter Notebooks documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

### Setting up your environment

Positron comes bundled with Jupyter kernel support for R and Python. Once you've [configured a Python or R environment](managing-interpreters.qmd) for Positron, you do not need to install any additional dependencies into your environment before using a notebook.

If an environment installed on your computer isn't available in Positron, you may want to read more about how Positron discovers [Python installations](python-installations.qmd) and [R installations](r-installations.qmd).

### Selecting an interpreter

When you first open a Jupyter Notebook, Positron automatically selects an interpreter based on the notebook's language, the current workspace, and your configuration.

::: callout-note
We recommend matching the selected interpreter for the workspace and the notebook, however, they can be controlled separately.
:::

You can manually select a different interpreter for the notebook by clicking the **Kernel Selector** button in the notebook editor action bar or by running the *Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel*  from the Command Palette.

### Customization

To set the default working directory of notebooks, use the [`notebook.workingDirectory`](positron://settings/notebook.workingDirectory) setting.
