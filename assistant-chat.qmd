## Chat pane

The chat pane provides a dedicated interface for asking questions, editing and debugging your code. Assistant responds based on your active session context, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and learn new techniques.

The chat pane integrates with your R and Python Console sessions, allowing you to interact with code, outputs, and in-memory objects like dataframes. Code generated by Assistant can be run in the Console, copied to the clipboard, or sent to an Editor using controls attached to code output blocks. The chat pane also accesses the Variables and Plots panes as needed.

Key features include:

- **[Chat agents](./assistant-chat-agents.qmd)**: Choose from default agents (Ask, Edit, Agent, Plan) or create custom agents to tailor Assistant's responses.
- **[Context](./assistant-chat-context.qmd)**: Attach files, interpreter sessions, tools, and source control history for more relevant responses.
- **[Commands and participants](./assistant-chat-commands-participants.qmd)**: Use commands for pre-defined actions and interact with dedicated participants for specific tasks.
- **[Custom prompts and instructions](./assistant-chat-prompts.qmd)**: Create and use custom prompt files and instructions to personalize your chat experience.

## Inline Chat

Inline chat is a mini chat interface that can be opened directly within your code Editor, Notebook, or Terminal. It allows you to ask questions, get suggestions, and apply changes without leaving your current context.

## Console actions

Positron Assistant provides quick assistance for errors in the Console. When you see an error, you can choose the following options to send your Console session to Assistant for immediate help:

- **Fix:** Assistant diagnoses the error and suggests a corrected version of your code. Use Fix to resolve errors quickly or apply recommended changes.
- **Explain:** Assistant describes what your code does, analyzes the error, and suggests possible solutions. Use Explain to learn more about your code or get advice on complex issues.

Fix and Explain inherit these options from the chat pane:

- Selected model
- Files added or removed from context
- Console session visibility

### Managing Console actions

- To disable Console actions, modify the [`positron.assistant.consoleActions.enable`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.consoleActions.enable) setting.
- To review your Fix and Explain chat history for the current chat session, run the _Chat: Open Quick Chat_ command and your chat history will appear in the Quick Chat overlay.
