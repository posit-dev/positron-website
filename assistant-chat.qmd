To use Positron Assistant features, you'll need to first configure a language model provider. See the [Getting Started](assistant-getting-started.qmd) guide for more details.

## Chat pane

The chat pane provides a dedicated interface for asking questions, editing and debugging your code. Assistant responds based on your active session context, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and learn new techniques.

You can interact with your R and Python Console sessions, including code, outputs, and in-memory objects like dataframes, via chat. Code generated by Assistant can be run in the Console, copied to the clipboard, or sent to an Editor using controls attached to code output blocks. Access to Variables and Plots panes provides additional context for your conversations.

### Opening the chat pane

To open the chat pane, select the chat robot icon in the sidebar or run the command _Chat: Open Chat_ from the Command Palette.

### Key features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[Chat agents](assistant-chat-agents.qmd)** | Choose from default agents (Ask, Edit, Agent, Plan) or create custom agents to tailor Assistant's responses. |
| **[Context](assistant-chat-context.qmd)** | Attach files, interpreter sessions, tools, and source control history for more relevant responses. |
| **[Commands and participants](assistant-chat-commands-participants.qmd)** | Use commands for pre-defined actions and interact with dedicated participants for specific tasks. |
| **[Custom instructions](assistant-chat-instructions.qmd)** | Create and use custom instructions to personalize your chat experience. |

## Inline chat

Inline chat is a mini chat interface that can be opened directly within your code Editor, Notebook, or Terminal. It allows you to ask questions, get suggestions, and apply changes without leaving your current context.

## Editor or notebook

To use the inline chat interface in an Editor or Notebook:

1. In an Editor or Notebook, place your cursor where you want to open the inline chat interface.
1. Open the inline chat interface using the default keybinding {{< kbd mac=Command-I win=Ctrl-I linux=Ctrl-I >}}; or, by running the command _Inline Chat: Open Inline Chat_ from the Command Palette.
1. Enter your question or request in the inline chat input box and press {{< kbd Enter >}} to send the message.
1. Accept or dismiss suggestions directly from the inline chat response.

Learn more about how to [Use editor inline chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/inline-chat#_use-editor-inline-chat) in the VS Code documentation.

## Terminal

To use the inline chat interface in a Terminal:

1. In a Terminal, place your cursor where you want to open the inline chat interface.
1. Open the inline chat interface using the default keybinding {{< kbd mac=Command-I win=Ctrl-I linux=Ctrl-I >}}; or, by running the command _Terminal: Open Inline Chat_ from the Command Palette.
1. Enter your question or request in the inline chat input box and press {{< kbd Enter >}} to send the message.
1. Accept or dismiss suggestions directly from the inline chat response.

## Console actions

Positron Assistant provides quick assistance for errors in the Console. When you see an error, you can choose the following options to send your Console session to Assistant for immediate help:

- **Fix:** Assistant diagnoses the error and suggests a corrected version of your code. Use Fix to resolve errors quickly or apply recommended changes.
- **Explain:** Assistant describes what your code does, analyzes the error, and suggests possible solutions. Use Explain to learn more about your code or get advice on complex issues.

Fix and Explain inherit these options from the chat pane:

- Selected model
- Files added or removed from context
- Console session visibility

### Managing Console actions

- To disable Console actions, modify the [`positron.assistant.consoleActions.enable`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.consoleActions.enable) setting.
- To review your Fix and Explain chat history for the current chat session, run the _Chat: Open Quick Chat_ command and your chat history will appear in the Quick Chat overlay.

## Managing models

You can customize which models Assistant has access to and set default preferences using the following settings:

- [`positron.assistant.models.preference.global`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.models.preference.global): Set a preferred model to be pre-selected across all providers. Matching is case-insensitive and supports partial matches.

- `positron.assistant.models.preference.<provider>` such as [`positron.assistant.models.preference.amazonBedrock`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.models.preference.amazonBedrock): Set a default model for a specific provider. Provider-specific preferences take precedence over the global preference.

- [`positron.assistant.models.include`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.models.include): Restrict which models are available by specifying patterns. Supports wildcards and regular expressions. Does not affect GitHub Copilot models.

- `positron.assistant.models.overrides.<provider>` such as [`positron.assistant.models.overrides.amazonBedrock`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.models.overrides.amazonBedrock): Manually configure models for a specific provider instead of retrieving listings automatically. Does not affect GitHub Copilot models.
