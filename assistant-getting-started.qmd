Positron Assistant supports **Anthropic Claude for chat** and **GitHub Copilot for code completions and chat**.

We're actively expanding provider support and welcome your [feedback](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions) and [issue reports](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/new/choose)!

## Step 1: Enable Positron Assistant

1. Enable the setting [`positron.assistant.enable`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.enable).
1. Restart Positron or run the _Developer: Reload Window_ command in the Command Palette.

## Step 2: Configure language model providers

Currently, we support **Anthropic** and **GitHub Copilot** for sidebar chat and inline chat. At this time, only **GitHub Copilot** is available for inline code completions.

## Anthropic

::: {.callout-important}
Positron Assistant requires a **Claude Console account with API access**. See Anthropic's [Claude API and Console](https://support.claude.com/en/collections/5370014-claude-api-and-console) documentation for more information.

Positron Assistant **does not** support logging into Anthropic with the Claude Pro Plan, Max Plan, or other Claude subscription plans.

<details>
<summary>How to get an Anthropic API key</summary>

1. Navigate to the [API keys](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys) management page.

## GitHub Copilot

::: {.callout-important}
Positron Assistant requires a **GitHub account with Copilot enabled**.

<details>
<summary>How to get GitHub Copilot access</summary>

GitHub Copilot is a proprietary tool from GitHub. If you want to use GitHub Copilot, you need a [subscription for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot) in your personal GitHub account or to be assigned a seat by an organization with a subscription for GitHub Copilot for Business.

Students and faculty can use GitHub Copilot for free as part of the GitHub Education program. For more information, see the [GitHub Education page](https://education.github.com/).

### Add GitHub Copilot as a language model provider

1. Run the command _Positron Assistant: Configure Language Model Providers_
1. Select **GitHub Copilot** as the model provider.

    ![GitHub Copilot selected in Provider modal](images/assistant-provider-modal-github-copilot.png){width=600}

1. Click the **Sign in** button to initiate GitHub's OAuth authentication flow.
    - Complete the authentication flow in your browser, and return to Positron when finished.

::: {.callout-tip}
If you are using Positron with a [remote SSH](remote-ssh.qmd) session, you will need to authenticate to GitHub on the _remote server_ as well. Follow [along on GitHub](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8409) as we make improvements in this area.

Once you've authenticated with at least one language model provider, you're all set to use Positron Assistant.

1. Click on the chat robot icon in the sidebar, or run the command _Chat: Open Chat_ in the Command Palette to open the chat:
