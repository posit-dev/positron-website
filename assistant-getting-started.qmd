::: {.callout-note}
Alternatively, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with Anthropic in Positron Assistant.
:::

## GitHub Copilot

::: {.callout-important}
Positron Assistant requires a **GitHub account with Copilot enabled**.

<details>
<summary>How to get GitHub Copilot access</summary>

GitHub Copilot is a proprietary tool from GitHub. If you want to use GitHub Copilot, you need a [subscription for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot) in your personal GitHub account or to be assigned a seat by an organization with a subscription for GitHub Copilot for Business.

Students and faculty can use GitHub Copilot for free as part of the GitHub Education program. For more information, see the [GitHub Education page](https://education.github.com/).

</details>
:::

### Add GitHub Copilot as a language model provider

1. Run the command _Positron Assistant: Configure Language Model Providers_
1. Select **GitHub Copilot** as the model provider.

    ![GitHub Copilot selected in provider modal](images/assistant-provider-modal-github-copilot.png){width=600}

1. Select the **Sign in** button to initiate GitHub's OAuth authentication flow.
    - Complete the authentication flow in your browser, and return to Positron when finished.

::: {.callout-note}
You can also sign in to GitHub via the {{< fa circle-user >}} **Accounts** icon in the Activity Bar. To sign out, use the Accounts icon or run the _Accounts: Manage Accounts_ command.

Note that the Accounts section manages your GitHub authentication for all extensions that use GitHub, not just Positron Assistant.
:::

## Amazon Bedrock

::: {.callout-important}
To use Amazon Bedrock in Positron Desktop, Positron Assistant requires an **AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access**, and you must sign in using the AWS CLI.

You must also [request access to the foundation models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) you want to use in your AWS Bedrock console before they appear in Positron.

<details>
<summary>Sign in with the AWS CLI</summary>

1. [Download and install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
1. [Configure your AWS credentials for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
1. [Sign in with the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html)

</details>

:::

### Enable Amazon Bedrock as a provider

Amazon Bedrock provider support is currently in **preview**. To enable it, run the command _Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)_ and add the following to your settings file:

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
{
    "positron.assistant.provider.amazonBedrock.enable": true
}
```
### Add Amazon Bedrock as a language model provider

1. Run the command _Positron Assistant: Configure Language Model Providers_
1. Select **Amazon Bedrock** as the model provider.

    ![Amazon Bedrock selected in provider modal](images/assistant-provider-modal-amazon-bedrock.png){width=600}

1. Select **Sign in** so Positron Assistant can verify your AWS CLI authentication.

### (Optional) Configure AWS region and profile

**`AWS_REGION`**

Positron Assistant reads `AWS_REGION` from your environment automatically. You only need to set it here if your shell does not already have `AWS_REGION` configured and your Bedrock-enabled account is not in `us-east-1` (the default). Use the standard AWS region identifier format (for example, `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-southeast-1`). The [Amazon Bedrock endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html) reference lists the region identifier for each location. You must also ensure the models you want to use are [available in that region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-regions.html).

**`AWS_PROFILE`**

Positron Assistant uses your `default` AWS CLI profile when no profile is specified. Set `AWS_PROFILE` if the profile you use for Bedrock is not named `default` — for example, when you have a dedicated Bedrock role separate from your general development credentials, or when your Bedrock access lives in a different AWS account. To see your available profiles, run `aws configure list-profiles` in a terminal. 

::: {.callout-note}
Do not set `AWS_PROFILE` if you use Posit Workbench managed credentials or environment variable credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`). Both of those paths bypass named profile resolution, and setting a profile name in those cases causes credential resolution to fail.
:::

To set either value, add them to the [`positron.assistant.providerVariables.bedrock`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.providerVariables.bedrock) setting. These override any matching environment variables already set on your system for Positron Assistant only; they do not affect your terminal or other tools. Changes require a restart to take effect.

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
{
    "positron.assistant.providerVariables.bedrock": {
        "AWS_REGION": "eu-west-1",
        "AWS_PROFILE": "my-bedrock-profile"
    }
}
```

### (Optional) Configure inference profile region

Positron Assistant uses [cross-region inference profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html) to route requests across multiple AWS regions for higher availability and throughput. Positron derives the inference profile region automatically from `AWS_REGION` by taking its geographic prefix:

| `AWS_REGION` | Derived inference profile region |
|---|---|
| `us-east-1`, `us-west-2` | `us` |
| `eu-west-1`, `eu-central-1` | `eu` |
| `ap-southeast-1`, `ap-northeast-1` | `apac` |

Most users do not need to change this. Use the [`positron.assistant.bedrock.inferenceProfileRegion`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.bedrock.inferenceProfileRegion) setting to override the derived value if:

- Your AWS account has Bedrock model access enabled in a different geographic pool than your `AWS_REGION` implies — for example, you connect through `us-east-1` but want to route inference through `eu` profiles.
- You want to use a `global` inference profile, which Positron cannot derive automatically from any region.

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
{
    "positron.assistant.bedrock.inferenceProfileRegion": "global"
}
```

Valid values are `us`, `eu`, `apac`, and `global`. This setting requires a restart to take effect.

::: {.callout-note}
If no inference profile exists for your preferred region, Positron Assistant falls back to the first available inference profile for that model. If a model has no inference profile at all, it does not appear in the model list.
:::

## Snowflake Cortex

::: {.callout-important}

To use Snowflake Cortex in Positron Desktop, Positron Assistant requires a **Snowflake account with Cortex access**, as well as a Snowflake [account identifier](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) and [programmatic access token](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) (PAT).

:::

### Enable Snowflake Cortex as a provider

Snowflake Cortex provider support is currently in **preview** and must be manually enabled.

Run the command _Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)_ and add the following to your settings file:

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
"positron.assistant.enabledProviders": [
    "snowflake-cortex"
]
```

### Add Snowflake Cortex as a language model provider

1. Add your `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` ID to the [`positron.assistant.providerVariables.snowflake`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.providerVariables.snowflake) setting
1. Run the command _Positron Assistant: Configure Language Model Providers_
1. Select **Snowflake Cortex** as the model provider.

    ![Snowflake Cortex selected in provider modal](images/assistant-provider-modal-snowflake-cortex.png){width=600}

1. Paste your Snowflake Cortex PAT into the API key box, then select **Sign in**.

## OpenAI

### Enable OpenAI as a provider

OpenAI provider support is currently in **preview** and must be manually enabled.

Run the command _Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)_ and add the following to your settings file:

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
"positron.assistant.enabledProviders": [
    "openai-api"
]
```

### Add OpenAI as a language model provider

1. Run the command _Positron Assistant: Configure Language Model Providers_
1. Select **OpenAI** as the model provider.

    ![OpenAI selected in provider modal](images/assistant-provider-modal-openai.png){width=600}

1. Paste your OpenAI API key into the input box and select **Sign in**.

::: {.callout-note}

Use the OpenAI provider to connect to a provider that implements the [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses), by replacing the base URL with your compatible custom endpoint.

:::

## Custom Provider

::: {.callout-important}

Positron Assistant's custom provider support is intended for use with any [OpenAI-compatible](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/openai-compatible-providers) API endpoint that uses the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint for chat.

At this time, we don't recommend using a local model as a custom provider. Read more about why [local models are not there (yet)](https://posit.co/blog/local-models-are-not-there-yet/) on Posit's blog.

:::

### Enable Custom Provider as a provider

Custom provider support is currently **experimental** and must be manually enabled.

Run the command _Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)_ and add the following to your settings file:

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
"positron.assistant.enabledProviders": [
    "openai-compatible"
]
```

### Add Custom Provider as a language model provider

1. Run the command _Positron Assistant: Configure Language Model Providers_
1. Select **Custom Provider** as the model provider.

    ![Custom Provider selected in provider modal](images/assistant-provider-modal-custom-provider.png){width=600}

1. Enter your API key and base URL into the input boxes and select **Sign in**.

::: {.callout-note}

Some OpenAI-compatible providers may not implement the `/models` endpoint, which Positron Assistant uses to list available models. If this is the case for your provider, you can manually configure a model listing using the [`positron.assistant.models.custom`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.models.custom) setting.

:::

:::

## Step 3: Use Positron Assistant!

Once you've authenticated with at least one language model provider, you're all set to use Positron Assistant.

1. Select the chat robot icon in the sidebar, or run the command _Chat: Open Chat_ in the Command Palette to open the chat:

    ![Assistant Sidebar Icon](images/assistant-sidebar-icon.png){height=450}
