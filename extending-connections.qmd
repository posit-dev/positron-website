The **Connections** pane can be extended by:

- Adding support for browsing and managing a new connection type in the **Connections** pane.
- Extending the "New connections" modal to support creating a connection of a new type.

## Adding new connection types

In R, you can extend connection types using the [RStudio connections contract](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/connections-contract.html).
Refer to the [RStudio connections contract documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/connections-contract.html) for more information on how to implement a new connection type.

For Python, we don't currently support an external extension mechanism. The **Connections** pane can be extended by implementing
a subclass of the `Connection` class (defined in [`connections.py`](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/blob/main/extensions/positron-python/python_files/posit/positron/connections.py)) and submitting a PR to the Positron repository. Refer to `SQLite3Connection` for [an example](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/blob/main/extensions/positron-python/python_files/posit/positron/connections.py).

## Extending the "New connections" modal

The "New connections" modal allows users to easily create connections to different databases. 
It helps users create a connection by providing a form to fill in the connection details.

The modal can be extended by creating an extension for Positron; see [Extension Development](extension-development.qmd) for more information. 

In order for an extension to provide support for a new connection type, it needs to implement and 
register a `positron.ConnectionsDriver`. A driver provides metadata about the connection type and
implements callbacks that are used to install dependencies required to create the connection, connect
with the database, and disconnect.

The definition can be found in [positron.d.ts](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/blob/main/src/positron-dts/positron.d.ts); look for `ConnectionsDriver`.

```ts
export interface ConnectionsDriver {
    /**
     * The unique identifier for the driver.
     */
    driverId: string;

    /**
     * The metadata for the driver.
     */
    metadata: ConnectionsDriverMetadata;

    /**
     * Generates the connection code based on the inputs.
     */
    generateCode?: (inputs: Array<ConnectionsInput>) => string;

    /**
     * Connect session.
     */
    connect?: (code: string) => Promise<void>;

    /**
     * Checks if the dependencies for the driver are installed
     * and functioning.
     */
    checkDependencies?: () => Promise<boolean>;

    /**
     * Installs the dependencies for the driver.
     * For instance, R packages would install the required
     * R packages, and or other dependencies.
     */
    installDependencies?: () => Promise<boolean>;
}
```

To register a driver, extensions need to call `positron.connections.registerConnectionDriver()` with
the driver instance as an argument.

Refer to [drivers.ts](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/blob/main/extensions/positron-connections/src/drivers.ts) for examples of drivers implemented in the Positron Connections extension.
