Positron ships with first class support for Python, along with [R](guide-r.qmd).

## Settings

::: {.callout-tip}
In addition to providing settings, Positron also provides keyboard shortcuts and bundled extensions, for a "batteries included" experience for data science with Python.

## Magics

Positron provides support for [IPython-style magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) in the Positron console (as well as Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, where appropriate). Magics are special commands prefixed with the `%` or `%%` symbol that provide convenient shortcuts for common tasks. You can see the supported magics by running the `%lsmagic` command in the Positron console.

Positron provides three new, custom magics created specifically for working in Positron:

- `%view` opens a Python object in the [Data Explorer](data-explorer.qmd). You can use this magic most simply via `%view df`, or additionally like `%view df.groupby('column').sum()` or `%view df "My Dataset"`.
- `%connection_show` shows a connection object in the [Connections Pane](connections-pane.qmd). Use this magic like `%connection_show my_connection`.
- `%clear` clears the Positron console.

## Code formatting

Positron can format Python code with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), a Python linter and formatter. Ruff is included in Positron as a [bootstrapped extension](extensions.qmd#bootstrapped-extensions) that is installed for you, including the bundled Ruff command line tool. Most Positron users do not need to do anything intentional to install Ruff or to keep it up-to-date.

You can format your Python code with various explicit and implicit gestures. You can use the commands *Format Selection* or *Format Document* to format specific bits of code. You can even configure Positron to run Ruff automatically whenever you save a Python file. In the Settings UI, search for `@lang:python editor.formatOnSave` and enable the setting, either at the workspace (recommended) or user level. This will add the following to the appropriate `settings.json`:

``` json
{
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
    }
}
```
