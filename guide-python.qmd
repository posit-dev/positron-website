Positron ships with first class support for Python, along with [R](guide-r.qmd).

## Settings

## Keyboard shortcuts

## Debugging

## Code formatting

Positron can format Python code with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), a Python linter and formatter. Ruff is included in Positron as a [bootstrapped extension](extensions.qmd#bootstrapped-extensions) that is installed for you, including the bundled Ruff command line tool. Most Positron users do not need to do anything intentional to install Ruff or to keep it up-to-date.

You can format your Python code with various explicit and implicit gestures. You can use the commands *Format Selection* or *Format Document* to format specific bits of code. You can even configure Positron to run Ruff automatically whenever you save a Python file. In the Settings UI, search for `@lang:python editor.formatOnSave` and enable the setting, either at the workspace (recommended) or user level. This will add the following to the appropriate `settings.json`:

``` json
{
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
    }
}
```
