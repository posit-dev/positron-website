The data grid is the primary display, with a spreadsheet-like cell-by-cell view.
It's intended to scale efficiently to relatively large in-memory datasets, up to
millions of rows or columns. 

![Data Explorer Grid Example](images/data-explorer-grid-example.png){width=700}

Each column header has the column name above the data type, which is dependent
on the backend type (language runtime or DuckDB). At the top right of each
column, there is a context menu to control sorting or to add a filter for the
selected column. Resize columns by clicking and dragging the column's borders.

Row labels default to the observed row index, with a zero-based index in Python
and a one-based index in R. Alternatively, `pandas` and R users may also have
rows with modified indices or string-based labels.

For long strings or other data values that do not fully fit in a grid cell, you
can see a tooltip containing the complete value by hovering over the cell:

Each Data Explorer instance watches the underlying data for changes, so if you
edit a data file or modify an in-memory dataframe, the changes will be reflected
in the Data Explorer. 


### Supported data frame libraries

pandas and Polars `DataFrame` objects are supported in Python, and `data.frame`,
`tibble`, and `data.table` are supported in R. Previews of database connections managed by the [Connections Pane](connections-pane.qmd) are also supported, for both Python and R.

Based on [user feedback](feedback.qmd#feedback-and-issues), we may add support for other libraries that expose a tabular data interface.

## Sorting

To sort the data by a column's values, open a column's context menu from the top
of the grid and click either "Sort Ascending" or "Sort Descending":

To clear an individual column's sort, click on the column header and select
"Clear Sorting" from the context menu.

When a column is sorted, the column header will have an arrow pointing up or
down indicating the sort direction. You can sort by multiple columns by opening
the context menu for a second column and sorting it, too. The number next to the
sort direction indicates the sort order of the column.

A Data Explorer can be sorted and filtered at the same time without any issues.

To clear all sorting, click on the "Clear Column Sorting" button in the top
action bar:

## Grid selection and copy-and-paste

The data grid has copy-and-paste capabilities similar to a spreadsheet. You can
select:

* A single cell
* A rectangular range of cells
* One or more entire rows
* One or more entire columns

To copy a single value, click on the cell of interest and press {{< kbd mac=Command-C win=Ctrl-C linux=Ctrl-C >}}. You can also copy
using the right-click context menu:

![Data Grid Cell Context Menu](images/data-explorer-copy-cell-context-menu.png){width=300}

To copy a rectangular range of cells, first click on a cell, then hold the
{{< kbd Shift >}} key and click on another cell to select the range of interest.
Then either press {{< kbd mac=Command-C win=Ctrl-C linux=Ctrl-C >}} or use the context menu to
copy:

When you copy a rectangular range of cells, the values are copied along with the
column names in tab-separated format to ease pasting into Excel or Google
Sheets. 

To copy whole rows or columns, click on the first row label or column label then
either hold {{< kbd Shift >}} and click on another row or column label to select a
range, or use {{< kbd mac=Command-C win=Ctrl-C linux=Ctrl-C >}} to select individual rows or columns, but not
necessarily a range:

![Copying Multiple Data Rows](images/data-explorer-copy-whole-rows.png){width=500}

![Copying Multiple Data Columns](images/data-explorer-copy-whole-columns.png){width=500}

Like copying a rectangular range of cells, copying an entire row or column will
include the column names in the tab-separated output.
