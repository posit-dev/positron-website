## Getting started with Publisher

The [Posit Publisher extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/posit/publisher) comes pre-installed with Positron as a [bootstrapped extension](extensions.qmd#bootstrapped-extension). This means it's available by default when you start Positron and updates automatically when new versions are released.

## What you can publish

[Connect](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/publishing-positron-vscode/) and [Connect Cloud](https://docs.posit.co/connect-cloud/user/publish/ide.html) support many of the most popular Python and R frameworks such as Shiny, Dash, Gradio, Streamlit, Bokeh, Quarto, R Markdown, Jupyter Notebook, FastAPI, Flask, Plumber, and more.

For a full list of supported project types, view the [Publisher documentation](https://github.com/posit-dev/publisher/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).
