When creating an extension, Positron is compatible with VS Code extensions so create it as you would for VS Code.

## Context Keys
When defining your extension's manifest, you can use `isPositron` for enablement or in a `when` clause.

```json
"commands": [
    {
        "category": "My Extension",
        "command": "myExtension.myCommand",
        "title": "My Extension Command",
        "enablement": "isPositron"
    }
]
```

This allows your extension to enable commands, keybindings, menu items, and any other contribution points only for Positron.
