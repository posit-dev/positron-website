Positron is compatible with VS Code extensions so you can create extensions [as you would for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension). You can use Positron to develop your extension and run it in a new **Extension Development Host** window.

## Context keys

When defining your extension's manifest, you can use `isPositron` for enablement or in a `when` clause.

```json
"commands": [
    {
        "category": "My Extension",
        "command": "myExtension.myCommand",
        "title": "My Extension Command",
        "enablement": "isPositron"
    }
]
```

This allows your extension to enable commands, keybindings, menu items, and any other contribution points only for Positron.

## Positron API

Positron provides [all the normal contribution points and the VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/overview) to extensions, but also additionally new APIs to use. We plan to make the extension development experience better (for example, [safely wrapping](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/458) and [providing typing for](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/809) the Positron API), but in the meantime, we recommend you [take a look at the Positron API details directly](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/tree/main/src/positron-dts).
