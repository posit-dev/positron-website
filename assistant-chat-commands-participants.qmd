## Slash commands

Slash commands provide quick access to common tasks without writing long prompts.

### Using slash commands

To use a slash command in the chat pane or inline chat, type the `/` character to bring up the command popup. Then, select a command and optionally add any additional instructions before sending the message.

### Available slash commands

Slash commands are provided by Positron Assistant and other installed extensions, as well as any [custom prompt files](assistant-chat-agents.qmd#custom-chat-agents) you have created.

Some built-in slash commands include:

- `/exportQuarto`: Generate a Quarto document from the current chat conversation.
- `/fix`: Fix a piece of code.
- `/explain`: Explain a piece of code or concept.

### Custom slash commands

Create custom slash commands by adding custom prompt files. This allows you to:

- Reuse prompts across chat requests and sessions
- Explicitly apply prompts to specific chat requests

Run the command _Chat: Configure Prompt Files..._ to manage custom prompt files in your chat sessions.

#### Create a custom prompt file

1. Run the command _Chat: New Prompt File..._ and follow the prompts to create a new prompt file.
1. Edit the newly created `.prompt.md` file to specify the prompt `description`, chat `agent`s the prompt should be available for, the `tools` the prompt can use, as well as the prompt content.

After creating a custom prompt file, you can access it through [slash commands](assistant-chat-commands-participants.qmd#slash-commands) in both the chat pane and inline chat.

<summary>Example custom prompt file</summary>

This shows a custom prompt tailored to exploratory data analysis which demonstrates key features of custom prompts in Positron Assistant. It includes header fields like `description`, `name`, `agent`, `tools`, and `argument-hint` to configure behavior and guide users. The prompt body uses an input variable (`${input:filePath}`) to accept dynamic user input, making it reusable across different projects and datasets. By specifying the agent mode and restricting what tools are available, the prompt tailors Assistant's behavior to exactly what's at hand.

description: Perform exploratory data analysis on the selected dataset
name: eda
agent: agent
tools: ['search', 'todos', 'getPlot', 'executeCode', 'getTableSummary', 'inspectVariables']
argument-hint: "Path to data file or dataset description"

You are a data analysis expert. Perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Load and inspect the data**: Display the first few rows, shape, and data types
2. **Summary statistics**: Generate descriptive statistics for all numeric columns
3. **Missing data analysis**: Identify and report any missing or null values
4. **Distributions**: Suggest visualizations for key columns
5. **Correlations**: Identify relationships between numeric variables

## Output Format

Structure your analysis as follows:
- **Dataset Overview**: Dimensions and column types
- **Key Findings**: Notable patterns or issues discovered
- **Recommended Next Steps**: Suggest specific analyses or visualizations

The user's dataset location is: ${input:filePath:e.g., data/sales.csv}

Perform the analysis using the available tools to execute code directly.

## Chat participants

Chat participants provide specialized knowledge to Positron Assistant. If you want help with a specific topic, you can add a chat participant to your conversation.

### Adding chat participants

To add a chat participant, enter `@` to bring up the chat participant popup. Then, select a participant and optionally add any additional instructions before sending the message.

### Available chat participants

Chat participants are provided by Positron Assistant and other installed extensions.

<summary>Shiny Assistant</summary>

Shiny Assistant is a chat participant available within Positron Assistant that provides context-aware assistance for developing Shiny applications in Python or R. It can help you with tasks such as generating Shiny UI components, server logic, and reactive expressions.

Shiny Assistant is available in the chat once you have installed the [Shiny extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/posit/shiny). Like other chat participants, Shiny Assistant can be invoked by typing `@shiny` in the chat pane or inline chat, followed by your question or request related to Shiny development.

Shiny Assistant enhances the default prompt with additional information about Shiny that we have found improves the quality of generated apps and Shiny components. It is also kept up to date with the latest Shiny features and best practices, in a way that is not practical with foundation models or fine-tuning.

<summary>GitHub Copilot</summary>

If you are authenticated with GitHub Copilot as a language model provider in Positron, you can use chat participants provided by GitHub Copilot when chatting with GitHub Copilot models in Positron Assistant.

Refer to the GitHub Copilot [Chat participants](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/copilot-vscode-features#_chat-participants) documentation for more information on available chat participants and how to use them.
