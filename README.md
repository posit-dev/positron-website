This is the repo for the Positron website at <https://positron.posit.co/>. 

This site is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [Posit product documentation theme](https://github.com/posit-dev/product-doc-theme), and these educational materials are released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Reporting issues

We currently use the issue tracker for [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron). Please report documentation bugs and feature requests at <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues>.

## Linting

This project uses [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/) for automated linting and compliance with the Posit style guide. 

- If you are a Posit employee, you can find the "Posit Documentation Style Guide" on Confluence.
- If you are an external contributor, we as reviewers will take responsibility for compliance with the guidelines. Thank you for being willing to improve our docs!

Vale runs [via GH action on PRs](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron-website/actions/workflows/lint.yml), but you can also run it locally before you submit a PR if you have [installed Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/) locally. Run `vale .` from the root directory of this project to lint the `.qmd` files used to build to site.

## Local development

If you have Quarto and Chrome or Edge installed locally, you can preview the site by running one of the Debug Configurations in VS Code or Positron.

The configurations run `quarto preview` and then open the site in a new browser window.
- **Preview Docs (Chrome)**: Preview the site in Chrome
- **Preview Docs (Edge)**: Preview the site in Edge

The site will re-render as you make changes to the `.qmd` files.
