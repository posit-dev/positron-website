### Selecting a notebook kernel

When you first open a Jupyter Notebook, Positron will automatically select an interpreter based on the notebook's language, the current workspace, and your configuration. The interpreter used by the notebook is visible in the _Kernel Selector_ in the notebook editor action bar.

::: callout-note
We recommend matching the notebook interpreter to the [active interpreter](./managing-interpreters.qmd#active-interpreter-session) of the IDE, however, they can be controlled separately. See [Managing Interpreters](./managing-interpreters.qmd) to learn more.
