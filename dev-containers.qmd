title: "Dev Containers"
description: "Run Positron projects in ephemeral containers, for reproducible development and deployment environments and dependency isolation."

Positron has preview support for [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/). With dev containers, you can run your sessions inside ephemeral containers, giving you full control over the execution environment and encouraging reproducibility and isolation.

## System requirements

Dev containers are supported in Positron Desktop on macOS, Windows, and Linux. However, the container itself must be built from a supported version of Linux. You also need a Docker-compatible container runtime, such as [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/). 

Note that you cannot currently use dev containers in environments that are *already* remote, such as Remote SSH, WSL, and Positron Pro sessions on Posit Workbench.

## Enabling

::: {.callout-important}
Dev containers are an experimental feature and must be manually enabled. Opt in to the [`dev.containers.enable`](positron://settings/dev.containers.enable) setting to enable the feature.

Or put this in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "dev.containers.enable": true
}
```

## Use

### Opening a folder in a container

Open a folder that contains a `.devcontainer.json` file. You'll see a prompt like this:

![Notification prompting to reopen folder in a container with Reopen in Container button](./images/dev-containers-reopen.png){width=468}

Click the notification to reopen in a container.

Alternately, if you've dismissed or disabled the notification, use the command _Dev Containers: Reopen in Container_.

### Attaching to a running container

![Remote Explorer view showing a list of running dev containers with action buttons](./images/dev-containers-remote-explorer.png){width=256}

1. Open the Remote Explorer view
2. Expand the "Dev Containers" section
3. Right-click a running container and select "Attach in Current Window" or "Attach in New Window", or use one of the buttons on the right

### Rebuilding a container

When you've made changes to your `devcontainer.json` or `Dockerfile`:

- _Dev Containers: Rebuild Container_ - Rebuild using cache
- _Dev Containers: Rebuild Without Cache_ - Full rebuild from scratch
- _Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container_ - Rebuild and automatically reopen

### Developing inside a container

Positron's dev containers feature uses a subset of the commands and settings available in VS Code. Read the VS Code guide on [developing inside a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for more information.

## Limitations

Unlike the Code OSS core, VS Code's Dev Containers support is not open source. It is provided by a proprietary, closed-source extension released under a [commercial license](https://code.visualstudio.com/preview-license). Consequently, Positron's implementation is novel, and does not have all the same features. Specifically, it has the following limitations:

- Positron does not support musl-based Linux distributions (such as Alpine) ([tracking issue](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10468)); the container must run a version of Linux that Positron already supports.
- Only single-container configurations are supported (no `docker compose`).
- No tools or templates are supplied for creating or authoring `devcontainer.json` files.
- Only one container is supported per project.
- Docker volumes are not supported, just regular mounts.
- In the MRU, dev containers show up with the remote rather than local path (e.g., `/workspaces/foo`).
- VS Code container customizations [are not supported](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11070).
- `RemoteCommand` [is not supported](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10009).
- Containers are not supported in environments that are already remote (such as Remote SSH, WSL, and Posit Workbench).
- Container management features (see/attach to running containers) are not available when already inside a container.

## Remote sessions

Once inside a container, your session will behave similarly to a Remote SSH session, as though you had started an SSH server on the container and used Remote SSH to connect to it. See [Remote SSH](remote-ssh.qmd) for more information.
