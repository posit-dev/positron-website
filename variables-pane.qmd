In addition to variables, if applicable, it displays data tables and any open [connections](connections-pane.qmd) for your session.

### Viewing variables

If the **Variables** pane is not already displayed, you can open it by clicking **View** > **Variables** or by running *Session: Focus on Variables View* from the Command Palette.

### Viewing data tables

If your session includes data tables, they appear in the **DATA** section of the Variables Pane. For more information about viewing your data tables, see the [Data Explorer](data-explorer.qmd) section.
