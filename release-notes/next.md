### Highlights

#### Remote sessions ðŸš€

This release brings a slew of improvements to the remote SSH experience in Positron. We've improved:

- our UI treatment of configured hosts
- the command to connect to your remote machine(s)
- bundling of components such as Quarto
- what happens when something goes wrong with the server download on your remote machine
- how you can manage the installation location of Positron server

Additionally, the most upvoted feature in this month's release is native support for remote sessions on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). You can now connect to WSL distributions as remote sessions in Positron, giving you a seamless development experience when working with Linux-based environments on Windows. If you previously used the community-maintained extension for WSL support, you will want to uninstall that extension and transition to the built-in functionality.

#### Positron Assistant ðŸ¤–

Our new release brings initial preview support for using [Positron Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant) with models provided by Amazon Bedrock, in addition to the existing support for models provided by Anthropic, GitHub Copilot, and [OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible providers](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions/9988).

Positron Pro sessions on Posit Workbench benefit from a smoother authentication experience with [Workbench-managed AWS Credentials](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/user/posit-workbench/managed-credentials/aws.html). Positron Desktop users can get started with Bedrock models by [manually authenticating via the AWS CLI](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions/10322).

We'll continue to improve the Bedrock experience in Positron, particularly around authentication. Stay tuned for updates in future releases!

#### Customize your plots display ðŸ“Š

One of the most upvoted features in this month's release is a new setting to customize the default sizing policy for the Plots pane, giving you more control over how your visualizations are displayed. Use the new [`plots.defaultSizingPolicy` setting](positron://settings/plots.defaultSizingPolicy) to configure how your plots are displayed by default if, for example, you prefer to always start with the "fill" option instead of the "auto" option. You can still change the sizing policy via the UI for plots after they are created, but this setting lets you set your preferred default behavior.
