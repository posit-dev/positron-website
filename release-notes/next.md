### Highlights

#### Positron Assistant ðŸ¤–

Positron Assistant, our AI client currently in preview, has received several updates in this release. We have made changes to reduce token usage, added an experimental git integration, and added new tools that the Assistant can use (for example, to create documents, view documentation, or to get info on your rectangular data). You can also now control Assistant's access to data in your Python and R sessions. If you have a problem with the Assistant that you want to report, use the commands that begin _Positron Assistant: Export the current chat_ to export your logs.

#### New keybinding âœ¨

The most upvoted feature request in this release is a new keybinding to execute the current statement in your Python or R Console _without_ advancing to the next one. You can now use <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> to execute your current statement without moving the cursor. (The existing keybinding <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Enter</kbd> executes the current statement and _does_ advance your cursor.)

#### Diagnostics and outlines for R ðŸ˜Œ

Our engine for providing R diagnostics has undergone a major upgrade! You'll notice that you no longer get overwhelmed with squiggles in your R code when you open a fresh session. Outlines in `.R` files have also been improved, especially for R6 methods and `targets` pipelines.

- [[#1428](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/1428)] R: `test_that()` blocks now appear in the outline and breadcrumbs, and also support sticky scroll functionality.
- [[#6546](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/6546)] R: all functions passed as named arguments also gain outline, breadcrumbs, and sticky scroll support. This improves the UX for R6 methods in particular.
- [[#8402](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8402)] R: added support for comment sections (like `# Title ----`) in function calls. This is especially useful for users of the `targets` package where it is common to have very large targets calls that can now be sectioned in the outline, with breadcrumbs and sticky scroll support.
- [[#6549](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/6549)] R: R6 methods are now exported as workspace symbols. You now search for them with <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + T</kbd>.
- [[#8330](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8330)] R: Added new [`positron.r.symbols.includeAssignmentsInBlocks` setting](positron://settings/positron.r.symbols.includeAssignmentsInBlocks) to control whether local variables in functions and nested `{}` blocks (e.g. in `test_that()` calls) appear in the outline. It's turned off by default to keep the outline focused on the overall structure of the file.
- [[#4886](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/4886)] R: Added new [`positron.r.workspaceSymbols.includeCommentSections` setting](positron://settings/positron.r.workspaceSymbols.includeCommentSections) to control whether comment sections (like `# Title ----`) are exported as workspace symbols. When enabled, you can search for the sections with <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + T</kbd>. This is disabled by default to keep symbol search focused on actual symbols.
- [[#5486](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/5486)] R: `browseURL()` now delegates to the operating system's default opener for inputs that are not recognized as a web URL or an HTML file.
- [[#8429](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8429)] Assistant: exported chat log now contains prompt and Positron context info. Use the commands that begin _Positron Assistant: Export the current chat_ to export logs when you want to report a problem with the Assistant.
- [[#1325](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/1325), [#8708](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8708), [#2252](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/2252)] R: the diagnostics engine is vastly improved in fresh sessions. You no longer have to attach packages in the console session to silence "unknown symbol" diagnostics in scripts. The issue has also been resolved in packages where a `load_all()` is no longer necessary to silence symbol diagnostics.
- [[#2778](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/2778)] Added new keybinding <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> to execute the current statement _without_ advancing.
- [[#6477](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/6477)] Positron (and Positron Assistant) can now automatically install packages into `uv` environments without `pip`.

- [[#4886](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/4886)] When a comment section (like `# Title ----`) is emitted as workspace symbol, and it clashes with another top-level definition (such as `Title <- function() {}`), the "Go to definition" feature now always prioritizes the definition of regular functions and variables.
- [[#8549](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8549)] R: fixed a race condition between the workspace indexer and diagnostics that caused spurious diagnotics on startup.
