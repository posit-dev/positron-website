### Highlights

#### New features in the Data Explorer üåü

We've introduced new features to help focus on key columns and navigate larger datasets during exploratory analysis.

Pin important columns or rows to keep them visible while scrolling through large datasets. When a column is pinned in the data grid, its corresponding row in the Summary Panel gets pinned as well, maintaining consistency across views.

Sort and filter rows in the Summary Panel to quickly view summary statistics for specific columns. Sort alphabetically by name or group by data type. Filter by column name to narrow down the list and focus on the columns most relevant to your current analysis.

#### GitHub Copilot Chat in Positron Assistant ü§ñ

[Positron Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant) now supports GitHub Copilot for both completions _and_ chat.

When you have GitHub Copilot added as a model provider, GitHub Copilot models, chat participants, and tools are now available in the chat pane and inline chat, in addition to inline code completions.

We're continuing to expand our support for additional language model providers, with support for custom providers in progress.

#### Manage Positron Assistant completions ‚öôÔ∏è

Completions from an LLM such as GitHub Copilot can be super useful, but sometimes they can be distracting or interfere with other completions from the Python or R LSP. You now have more control over when you see Positron Assistant completions:

- Snooze these completions temporarily from the Assistant status bar popup.
- Disable completions for the current file type (or all files) from the same status bar popup.
- Use the new _Positron Assistant: Toggle (Enable/Disable) Completions_ command to toggle these completions.
