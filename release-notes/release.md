### Highlights

#### Positron Assistant ðŸ¤–

Positron Assistant, currently available as a preview feature, is now more powerful and versatile. New slash commands (`/fix`, `/explain`, and `/doc`) are available to debug, understand, and document code. These commands can even be triggered automatically; for example, you can convert a chat into a Quarto document just by asking, "Can you convert this to Quarto?", even if you don't specify the `/exportQuarto` command as part of your message.

"Fix" and "Explain" support for Console errors has also been introduced. With a single click, the Assistant can fix or explain an error, acting as a coding partner for troubleshooting. You can try it out by enabling the [`positron.assistant.consoleActions.enable` setting](positron://settings/positron.assistant.consoleActions.enable). 

Ways you already use Assistant have been enhanced. Code completions and inline chat are now available in notebooks, giving you access to the features you love no matter where you code. Assistant now also integrates with Git by default, letting you seamlessly chat about your project's history and providing suggestions when writing commit messages. Assistant can also now use the data summary tool for R objects, similar to what you have already been able to do in Python.

#### Convert your Data Explorer filters to code ðŸ’¥

The Data Explorer now provides a **Convert to Code** button to make your analysis more reproducible. With one click, you can copy code to your clipboard that reflects the filters and sorts you have set up via the Data Explorer UI. Paste the code into the Console, a script, or a notebook to continue your data exploration with runnable, reproducible code. This feature currently supports both pandas and polars Python dataframes, with additional backends coming soon! 

#### DuckDB for Python ðŸ¦†

The [Connections Pane](https://positron.posit.co/connections-pane.html) now supports managing and exploring native DuckDB connections in Python, as has already been possible for R. Connect to local or remote DuckDB databases, explore their schemas, and interactively preview your DuckDB tables.
