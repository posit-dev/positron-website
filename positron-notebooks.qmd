Positron Native Notebooks is currently in **pre-alpha testing** and is not yet available for production use. 

We are targeting a public alpha in February 2026. 

If you'd like to be an early design partner and help shape our future roadmap, please book time to chat with [us here](https://scheduler.zoom.us/cindy-tong/improving-the-positron-notebook-experience)

## Our Vision 

Positron Native Notebooks provides a familiar notebook experience for Jupyter (`.ipynb`) files. Positron IDE features work out of the box in notebooks, including AI assistance, data exploration, and debugging.

## Key features 

* Batteries-included experience—no extensions required for core features
* Simplified user experience for core data science workflows 
* Notebook-aware AI assistance 
* Integrated data exploration (Variables Pane and Data Explorer) 
* Debugging that works out of the box 
* Your idea here! We want to [hear from you](https://scheduler.zoom.us/cindy-tong/improving-the-positron-notebook-experience) about what features you want to see in Positron Notebooks.

*These features are a work in progress, and we expect to regularly deploy changes as you are testing. *

## How to test 
1. Download the latest Positron release [here](https://positron.posit.co/download.html). Use at least version 2025.12.1-4.

2. Update your User Settings with the following settings to enable Positron Notebooks and Notebook AI features:
   a. Ensure Assistant is enabled: [`positron.assistant.enable`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.enable)
   b. Enable Positron notebooks: [`positron.notebook.enabled`](positron://settings/positron.notebook.enabled)
   c. Enable Notebook AI features: [`positron.assistant.notebookMode.enable`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.notebookMode.enable)

3. We recommend using the _View: Notebook Layout_ command for the best experience. Search for this command in the Command Palette. This layout displays the Variables pane by default.

4. Pick a notebook to explore:
   a. Explore our demo [World Happiness Report notebook](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron-demos-notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/world-happiness-report) by following the **New** > **New Folder from Git** workflow, or 
   b. Create a new notebook:
      - Select **New** > **New Folder from Template** > **Jupyter Notebook** 
      - Follow the instructions for folder creation and environment management 

5. When you open a `.ipynb` file for the first time, you see the default VS Code notebook UI. To see the Positron Native Notebook view:
   a. Right-click on the file in the Explorer 
   b. Click **Open With** 
   c. Select **Positron Notebooks**
   d. (Optional) Click the **Set as Default** button to always open `.ipynb` files with Positron Notebooks in the future
