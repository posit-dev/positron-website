Positron Assistant is an AI client that provides LLM integration within Positron, both for chat and for inline completions. Currently available in **preview** (Positron 2025.07.0-204 and beyond), it supports **Anthropic Claude for chat** and **GitHub Copilot for code completions and chat**.

We're actively expanding provider support and improving the experience, and welcome you to provide [feedback](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions) and report any [issues](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/new/choose) you encounter!

## Built for data science workflows

Positron Assistant is developed with the understanding that data science work is interactive and exploratory. Beyond having access to your code files, it can also see your loaded data, plots, and Console inputs and outputs.

Since much of data science and analysis happens interactively as you load data, explore it through cleaning and transformations, create visualizations, and build models, this context allows Assistant to provide more relevant guidance.

Positron Assistant is provided relevant information about your current workspace through metadata about your Positron environment and through tool calling:

- Variables pane: Names, dimensions, and column names of dataframes and database connections, plus metadata for arrays, lists, and other objects in memory
- Plots pane: Describe current plots and suggest variations or next steps for iteration
- Console: View inputs and outputs, plus execute code and see results
- Session state: Active language (Python/R + version), loaded packages, and installed packages

This session-aware context works alongside traditional AI capabilities like understanding your active files, selected code, and project structure.

## Features

Use Positron Assistant to generate or refactor code, ask questions, get help with debugging, and get suggestions for next steps in your data science projects.
