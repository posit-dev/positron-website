Welcome to Positron, the next-generation data science IDE built for Python and R. It combines the power of a full-featured IDE with interactive data science tools for Python and R.

#### Positron might be a good fit for you if you...

-   use VS Code for data science (Python or R) but wish it included more interactive affordances for data-specific tasks like running exploratory code, examining your variables and datasets, interacting with your plots, and developing data apps such as Shiny, Streamlit, or FastAPI.
-   use JupyterLab or hosted notebook tools for data science (Python or R) and are ready for a more powerful, fully-featured IDE that still supports notebooks.
-   use RStudio and want more ability to customize or extend your IDE.
-   use additional languages beyond only Python or R in your day-to-day data science or package development work, like Rust, C++, JavaScript, or Lua.
-   want access to powerful, data-science specific AI integrations in a modern, extensible IDE.
