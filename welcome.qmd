Interested in Positron for your team? [Learn about enterprise solutions.](https://posit.co/products/ide/positron/?utm_source=positron-docs&utm_medium=features-page)


## Positron might be a good fit for you if you {#use-cases}

-   use VS Code for data science (Python or R) but wish it included more interactive affordances for data-specific tasks like running exploratory code, examining your variables and datasets, interacting with your plots, and developing data apps such as Shiny, Streamlit, or FastAPI.
-   use JupyterLab or hosted notebook tools for data science (Python or R) and are ready for a more powerful, fully-featured IDE that still supports notebooks.
-   use RStudio and want more ability to customize or extend your IDE.
-   use additional languages beyond only Python or R in your day-to-day data science or package development work, like Rust, C++, JavaScript, or Lua.
-   want access to powerful, data-science specific AI integrations in a modern, extensible IDE.

Positron is built on [Code OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), the open-source foundation of Visual Studio Code. For general editor features like commands, settings, and source control, reference the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).
