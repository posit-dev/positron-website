title: "Discovering Python Installations"

This guide explains how Python installations are discovered and managed in Positron.

## Python installation discovery

Positron uses multiple strategies to discover Python interpreters and virtual environments across your system.
The discovery process includes both global Python installations and various virtual environment managers.

### Supported environment managers

Positron supports the following Python environment managers:

* **pip + venv**: Standard library virtual environments created with `python -m venv`
* **pyenv**: Python installations managed by `pyenv`, including virtual environments
* **uv**: Virtual environments and Python installations managed by `uv`
* **Conda/Miniconda/Anaconda**: Conda environments created with `conda create` or `mamba create`
* **And more**, including Poetry, Hatch, Pixi, and others

### Discovery locations

Positron searches for Python interpreters in the following locations:

**Virtual environments**

* `.venv/` and `.conda/` folders in your workspace directory
* Tool-managed project installations (e.g. `uv`, `poetry`)

**Global Python installations**

* System Python installations in standard locations
* Certain tool-managed installations (e.g. `pyenv`, `conda`)

Note that using a system Python installation in a new session can lead to problems (see the official [guidance](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/) about this).
For that reason, we recommend using virtual environments.

**Custom locations**

* Interpreters listed in the [`python.interpreters.[include,exclude,override]`](positron://settings/python.interpreters.include) settings (see the below [section](#related-settings) for details)

## Environment creation and discovery

### Creating new environments

You can create new Python environments directly from Positron using the **Python: Create Environment** command:

1. Open the Command Palette (<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
2. Run **Python: Create Environment**
3. Choose from available environment providers:
   - **venv**: Creates a standard virtual environment using `python -m venv`
   - **conda**: Creates a conda environment (if conda is available)
   - **uv**: Creates a uv-managed virtual environment (if uv is available)

The environment will be created in your workspace and automatically discovered.

You can also use the **New Folder From Template** feature to create a new Python project, and set up an environment as part of the project.

### Discovering existing environments

Positron automatically discovers environments when:

- The extension starts up
- You open a new workspace folder
- Certain file system changes are detected in watched directories
- You manually refresh using the **Interpreter: Discover All Interpreters** command

The discovery process runs in the background and updates the interpreter list as new environments are found.

## Discovery process details

### Unsupported Python versions

Positron only supports Python minor versions 3.9 through 3.13, which are the [currently-supported versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
Other versions may be discovered, but you may run into issues using them.

### Locator type

Positron can use two different discovery mechanisms:

* **JavaScript locator** (default): Pure TypeScript implementation for more comprehensive discovery
* **Native locator** (experimental): Uses a native binary for faster discovery

You can control this with the `python.locator` setting (`"native"` or `"js"`).
Keep in mind that the `native` locator is experimental and may not work completely as intended.

## Related settings

Key settings that control Python environment discovery:

### Discovery location settings
* [`python.interpreters.include`](positron://settings/python.interpreters.include): Specific interpreter paths to include
* [`python.interpreters.exclude`](positron://settings/python.interpreters.exclude): Interpreter paths to exclude from discovery
* [`python.interpreters.override`](positron://settings/python.interpreters.override): Override the above two settings so only these are shown

### Environment providers
* [`python.environmentProviders.enable`](positron://settings/python.environmentProviders.enable): Enable/disable specific environment providers for environment creation (`Venv`, `Conda`, `uv`)

### Discovery behavior
* [`python.locator`](positron://settings/python.locator): Choose between "native" or "js" discovery methods
* [`python.defaultInterpreterPath`](positron://settings/python.defaultInterpreterPath): Default Python interpreter path (used only the first time when no other interpreter takes precedence)

## Related commands

* **Interpreter: Discover All Interpreters**: Find new interpreters
* **Interpreter: Select Interpreter Session**: Select an interpreter for a session
* **Python: Create Environment**: Create a new virtual environment

## Troubleshooting

### Environment not appearing

If the above settings are configured correctly, and the Python version is supported, and a restart of Positron is not helping, you can check logs. See more in the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.qmd).

For the `js` (default) locator, the discovery process is logged in the Python Language Pack channel of the Output panel.

For the `native` locator, it is instead logged in the Python Locator channel.

### Performance issues

If environment discovery is slow:

* Consider using the native locator (`python.locator`: `"native"`)
* Limit the scope of discovery by setting specific paths in the settings
