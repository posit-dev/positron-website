## Opening the Plots Pane

If the **Plots** pane is not already displayed, you can open it by clicking **View** > **Plots** or by running *Session: Focus on Plots View* from the Command Palette.

## Viewing plots

When you create a plot in Python or R, it automatically appears in the Plots Pane. The pane maintains a history of all plots generated during your session, allowing you to navigate back and forth between them.

### Plot history navigation

Use the navigation arrows in the Plots Pane toolbar to browse through your plot history:

- {{< fa arrow-left >}} Show previous plot
- {{< fa arrow-right >}} Show next plot

### Zooming

You can zoom in on plots to examine details more closely. Use the zoom controls in the toolbar or open your plot in an editor tab or a new window.

### Saving and exporting plots

The Plots Pane provides several options for saving and sharing your visualizations.

- **Copy plot to clipboard:** Copy the current plot to your clipboard for pasting into other applications
- **Save plot:** Export the plot to a file in various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF, etc.)

## Plots gallery

To pop the whole Plots Pane UI to a separate auxiliary window, either run the command _Plots: Open Plots Gallery in New Window_ or click {{< fa regular window-maximize >}} from the Plots Pane action bar.

## Plots settings

Key settings control how you interact with your data visualizations.

* [`plots.defaultSizingPolicy`](positron://settings/plots.defaultSizingPolicy): The default sizing policy to use for newly created plots
* [`plots.darkFilter`](positron://settings/plots.darkFilter): Use a color filter to make light plots appear dark
* [`plots.freezeSlowPlots`](positron://settings/plots.freezeSlowPlots): Freeze slow-to-generate plots at a fixed size to avoid rendering repeatedly on viewport changes
* [`plots.historyPolicy`](positron://settings/plots.historyPolicy): When the plot history filmstrip is visible
