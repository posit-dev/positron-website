title: "Data Explorer"
---

The Data Explorer is designed to complement code-first exploration of data,
allowing you to display data in a spreadsheet-like grid, temporarily filter and
sort data, and provide useful summary statistics directly inside of Positron.
The goal of the Data Explorer isn't to replace code-based workflows, but rather
supplement with ephemeral views of the data or summary statistics as you further
explore or modify the data via code.

The Data Explorer can be used to view raw data files (CSV, Parquet, etc.) in your
Positron workspace as well as dataframes in your active Python or R sessions.

The Data Explorer has three primary components, discussed in greater detail in the sections below:

* **Data grid:** Spreadsheet-like display of the individual cells and columns, as well as sorting
* **Summary panel:** Column name, type and missing data percentage for each column
* **Filter bar:** Ephemeral filters for specific columns

## Opening the Data Explorer

To open the Data Explorer, you can use one of the following methods:

* Click on a data file in the File Explorer Pane or open a data file from the
  command palette. Currently `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.parquet` files are supported,
  but more formats may be added in the future. GZIP-compressed CSV files ending
  in `.gz` can also be opened.
* Navigate to the Variables Pane and click on the Data Explorer icon for a
  specific dataframe object
* Use the language runtime directly:
    * Via Python: `%view dataframe label`
    * Via R: `View(dataframe, "label")`

In Python, the `%view` magic can also be used with expressions, for example
`%view df[df['column'] > 10]`. In R, the `View` function can be composed
with expressions using pipe syntax:

```r
df %>% mutate(doubled_column = column * 2) 
   %>% View()
```

Each data explorer instance watches the underlying data for changes, so if you
edit a data file or modify an in-memory dataframe, the changes will be reflected
in the data explorer.

### Supported Data Frame Libraries

pandas and Polars `DataFrame` objects are supported in Python, and `data.frame`,
`tibble`, and `data.table` are supported in R. Based on user feedback, we may add
support for other libraries that expose a tabular data interface.

## Data grid

The data grid is the primary display, with a spreadsheet-like cell-by-cell view.
It's intended to scale efficiently to relatively large in-memory datasets, up to
millions of rows or columns. Each column header has the column name above the
data type, as used in the language runtime. At the top right of each column,
there is a context menu to control sorting or to add a filter for the selected
column. Resize columns by clicking and dragging the column's borders.

Row labels default to the observed row index, with a zero-based index in Python
and a one-based index in R. Alternatively, `pandas` and R users may also have
rows with modified indices or string-based labels.

## Summary panel

The summary panel displays a vertical scrolling list of all of the column names
and an icon representing their respective type. It displays a sparkline
histogram of that column's data, and also displays the amount of missing data as
both an inline bar graph and an increasing percentage.

Double clicking on a column name will also bring the column into focus in the
data grid, allowing for quickly navigating wider data.

1. The summary panel can be collapsed by dragging the grid and summary panel
   divider to the edge or by clicking on the collapse button after hovering over
   the divider. If you prefer to collapse the summary panel by default, this can
   be configured via the `dataExplorer.summaryCollapsed` setting.

2. The summary panel can also be placed on the left or right side of the Data
   Explorer via the Layout control.

## Selection and Copy-and-Paste

## Filtering

The filter bar has controls to:

1. Add, Show/Hide existing filters, or Clear Filters
2. A <kbd>+</kbd> button to quickly add a new filter
3. The status bar at the bottom of the Data Explorer also displays the
   percentage and number of remaining rows relative to the original total after
   applying a filter

When creating a new filter, you will first need to select a column either by
scrolling the full list or searching across columns for a specific string. Once
a column is selected, the available filters for that column type will be
displayed. Alternatively, the context menu in each column label of the data grid
also allows for creating filters with the column name pre-populated.

Available filters vary according to the column type. For example, string columns
have filter affordances for: contains, starts or ends with, is empty, or exact
matches. Alternatively, numeric columns have logical operations such as: is less
than or greater than, is equal to, or is inclusively between two values.
