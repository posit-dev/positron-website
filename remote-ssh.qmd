title: "Remote SSH"
---

Positron has **experimental** support for Remote SSH sessions. This feature allows the Positron IDE's front end (user interface) to run on one machine, while the back end (files, projects, Python and R sessions, etc.) runs on another machine. The two machines communicate using an ordinary secure shell (SSH) connection.

end
```

## System requirements

Remote SSH sessions can be *initiated* from any operating system supported by Positron itself, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. However, the system you are *connecting* to must be running Linux using a **recent distribution**, such as Ubuntu 22+ or RedHat 9+, on an x86-compatible processor. Older Linux distributions and arm64 hosts aren't currently supported.

Other features that aren't currently supported include:

- Connecting to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) backends[^1]
- Dev Container workflows (note however that you can start a container yourself and connect to it)

[^1]: Although Positron does not officially support connecting to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) backends at this time, there is a community-maintained fork of the [Open Remote - WSL](https://github.com/kv9898/open-remote-wsl) extension adapted for Positron, available on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/kv9898/open-remote-wsl). The community-maintained WSL extension behaves very similarly to the remote SSH functionality described in this article. This WSL extension is not maintained by the Positron team or Posit.

## Creating a connection

To create a connection, open the Command Palette (<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and type "Remote Menu". Run the _Remote SSH: Show Remote Menu_ command.

From there, run the _Connect to Host_ command. You will be prompted to enter the hostname and your credentials.

If you want to avoid having to type the hostname every time, add the connection information to your user SSH config (e.g. `~/.ssh/config` on Unix-alikes). Then you can use the _Remote Explorer_ view to connect to the system again in the future. Use the _View: Show Remote Explorer_ command to open it.

## Remote sessions

You can identify remote SSH sessions via a small indicator in the bottom left of Positron's window.

There are some notable differences between these sessions and "regular" Positron desktop sessions.

### Files

Inside a remote host, the Explorer tab will show you files from the remote host instead of your local system.

### Settings

When connected to a remote host, you will see two different Settings; one is settings for your local machine and the other is settings that apply to the remote machine.

### Extensions

Most extensions run on Positron's back end. This means that the first time you connect to a remote host, you won't have any extensions installed. You'll need to reinstall any extensions on the remote host that you want to use on that host.

Like the Explorer view, the Extensions view will help you see which extensions are installed locally and which are installed on the remote host.

### Terminals, R, and Python

All Terminals as well as your R and Python sessions will run on the remote host.

### Port forwarding

When you run web applications (e.g. Shiny applications) in Positron, Positron automatically maps the port on the remote host to a port on your local machine.

For example, note that this Shiny application running on `:6868` automatically gets a forwarded port `6868` on the local host. The _Ports_ tab shows which ports are currently forwarded from the remote to the local host. Positron tries to use the same port on both hosts when it's available.

## How it works & troubleshooting

When Positron connects to a new host for the first time, it does the following:

1. Establishes an SSH connection to the host.
2. Forms the name and download URL of the correct Positron Server binary, e.g. `positron-reh-linux-x64-2025.01.0-39.tar.gz`
3. On the remote host, downloads this binary into `~/.positron-server` and unpacks it.
4. Starts the headless Positron Server inside the remote host.
5. Connects to the server from the front end.

The two most common problems are:

- Encountering a 404 when downloading the Positron Server binary. This happens when you attempt to use Remote SSH against a host type that's not supported, for example, connecting to a macOS host.
- Encountering an error when starting the Positron Server binary. This happens when you attempt to use Remote SSH against a version of Linux that's not supported by Positron.

If you need to use a different URL to download Positron Server (for example to use a local copy due to network constraints, or to force the use of a particular version even if it's not autodetected), you can edit this setting:

Note that the client and server must be using **exactly** the same Positron version.
