TO WRITE re: Workspace management

* Saving/loading tools (or lack thereof)
* Package tools
* Testing, building, etc.

Figure out how this relates to existing content re: the `.Rproj` file: [The Rproj File](rstudio-rproj-file.qmd).

Add new advice, somewhere, for opening and switching focus between workspaces with *Open Recent ...* and opening in tabs (as opposed to windows). See <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8237>.
