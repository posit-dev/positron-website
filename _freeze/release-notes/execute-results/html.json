While still in alpha, we're releasing early because we believe the best tools are built in collaboration with the community.\n\nThe Positron Notebook Editor provides a batteries-included environment for data science workflows with integrated panes for inspecting variables and exploring dataframes, context-aware AI that understands your notebook's execution history and variables, and streamlined interpreter management.\n\nTo try it out, enable the [`positron.notebook.enabled`](positron://settings/positron.notebook.enabled) setting. Check out our [documentation](https://positron.posit.co/notebooks-alpha) to get started, and please [share your feedback](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions/10047)!\n\n#### Connections Pane 🔌\n\nThe [Connections Pane](https://positron.posit.co/connections-pane) lets you create connections to databases, explore their schemas, and interactively preview tables in the Data Explorer. This release expands Python database support with new drivers for SQL Server (via pymssql or pyodbc), Databricks, Snowflake, and BigQuery, each with multiple authentication methods including OAuth and service account options.\n\nFor R users, database connections now also appear in the Variables Pane, making it easier to access and explore your connections alongside other session objects.\n\n#### Breakpoints and debugging in R 🛠️\n\nR now has first-class support for breakpoints in Positron. Set breakpoints in the editor gutter and step through your code interactively. In scripts, breakpoints are enabled after evaluation or sourcing. In packages, install the latest version of pkgload and call `load_all()` to activate breakpoints.\n\nThis release also adds debug-specific command history; use <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Up</kbd> to navigate through commands from your debugging sessions separately from your regular console history.\n\n<div id=\"checkbox\"></div>\n\n### Changelog\n\n#### New features\n\n- [[#9074](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/9074)] Per-kernel resource usage information is now displayed in the console tab list.\n- [[#10433](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10433)] Connections Pane: added support for SQL Server databases using pymssql or pyodbc.\n- [[#11080](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11080)] Connections Pane: added Python Databricks connection drivers supporting Personal Access Token, OAuth M2M, and OAuth U2M authentication methods.\n- [[#9961](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/9961), [#11078](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11078)] Connections Pane: added Snowflake connection support with multiple authentication methods.\n- [[#11079](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11079)] Connections Pane: added BigQuery connection driver for Python with support for Application Default Credentials and Service Account authentication.\n- [[#10818](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10818), [#11357](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11357)] Connections Pane: added viewer support for R database connections in the Variables Pane.\n- [[#7031](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/7031)] Plots: the Plots Pane now shows which session created the plot.\n- [[#10183](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10183)] Plots: the Plots Pane can now navigate to, copy, or re-run the code used to create a plot.\n- [[#8216](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8216)] Assistant: added [`positron.assistant.aiExcludes`](positron://settings/positron.assistant.aiExcludes) setting to exclude files from all AI features including inline completions and chat context.\n- [[#10967](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10967)] Assistant: improved reliability of Positron Assistant to edit files directly while in Edit mode.\n- [[#11166](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11166)] Assistant: model picker now shows a \"(Default)\" indicator next to the model configured as default for each provider.\n- [[#11463](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11463)] Assistant: added setting to configure Amazon Bedrock inference profile region for use with Positron Assistant.\n- [[#8075](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8075)] Added support for using R and Python installations via environment modules/Lmod.\n- [[#11246](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/11246)] Added new button to interrupt a running Shiny app (Python or R) from the Viewer pane.\n- [[#8870](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8870)] Python: Assistant will now use `uv add` when appropriate when installing Python packages.\n- [[#3156](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/3156), [#10045](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10045)] Python: If code is run from an editor, the editor path is now added to `sys.path` for that cell.\n- [[#3673](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/3673)] R: opening a file via `rstudioapi::navigateToFile(path)` now opens a non-preview, pinned editor.\n- [[#2955](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/2955)] R: added [`positron.r.localPackageInstallMethod`](positron://settings/positron.r.localPackageInstallMethod) setting to use base R commands for package development tasks. When changed from the default, uses `R CMD INSTALL` instead of pak for installing a local R package project.\n- [[#1766](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/1766)] R: gained support for breakpoints.
