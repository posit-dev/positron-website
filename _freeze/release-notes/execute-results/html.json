Your Console inputs are tracked by language and grouped by time period. You can search your history, send entries to the Console or an editor, and clear individual entries (handy if you accidentally entered a secret) or the entire history. Find the History pane on the right in the secondary side bar by default, or run _History: Focus on History View_ from the command palette.\n\n#### Positron Assistant 🤖\n\nPositron Assistant, available as a preview feature, is now more powerful and reliable:\n\n- Assistant has switched to using a native implementation of the Copilot completion engine, addressing a variety of authentication and performance issues. Copilot credentials now also work in Remote SSH sessions, and VS Code proxy settings are respected when connecting to GitHub Copilot.\n- Assistant's tools, such as for editing files, installing packages, and getting directory structure, have been refined.\n- You can now create custom agent files for your projects. Read more at <https://positron.posit.co/assistant-chat-agents>.\n\n#### Try experimental Dev Container support 🐳\n\nPositron now has early, experimental support for [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/). You can build or rebuild a container and open your workspace inside it. To try it out, enable the [`dev.containers.enable`](positron://settings/dev.containers.enable) setting. Note that this early version has some limitations; only single-container configurations are supported (no Docker Compose), and musl-based Linux distributions like Alpine are not yet supported.\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions) how it goes with our new Dev Container support!\n\n<div id=\"checkbox\"></div>\n\n### Changelog\n\n#### New features\n\n- [[#5484](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/5484)] Added a History pane to Positron, similar to RStudio's.\n- [[#4691](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/4691)] Added experimental support for Dev Containers.\n- [[#9948](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/9948)] Console: following up on the shared notebook/console kernel feature, notebook console action buttons are now hidden by default.
