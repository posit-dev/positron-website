We changed our Python language server approach so you can install your own extension of choice to provide syntax highlighting and other language server features; we've tested out basedpyright, ty, Pyrefly, and ZubanLS and expect all to work in Positron now. One of our goals is to provide a great \"batteries included\" experience for all users (including those who aren't sure which to choose) so, starting with this release, we now bundle the [Pyrefly](https://open-vsx.org/extension/meta/pyrefly) extension.\n\nWe no longer bundle the Pyright extension because its functionality overlaps with Pyrefly. If you do not want to use Pyrefly, disable that extension. You also will want to uninstall the Python Environments extension if you have it, because its features do not work in Positron.\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions) how it goes with our new Python language server support!\n\n#### Positron Assistant 🤖\n\nThis release brings several improvements to make Assistant more reliable and easier to troubleshoot. Two new commands help you manage your Assistant configuration:\n\n- _Positron Assistant: Reset State_ lets you start totally fresh when needed.\n- _Positron Assistant: Collect Diagnostics_ generates a diagnostics report to help identify issues. \n  \nWe have also improved token efficiency across many tools and introduced preview support for Snowflake Cortex as a language model provider.\n\n#### Run your code with new keyboard shortcuts 💥\n\nThe most upvoted feature in this month's release is a new set of keyboard shortcuts for running code from your document beginning to the current line <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Home</kbd> and from the current line to your document end <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+End</kbd>. If you opt in the RStudio Keymap, these are available as <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+B</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+E</kbd>.\n\n<div id=\"checkbox\"></div>\n\n### Changelog\n\n#### New features\n\n- [[#10104](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10104), [#10243](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10243), [#10241](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/10241)] Added new Catalog Explorer support for Snowflake data catalogs.
