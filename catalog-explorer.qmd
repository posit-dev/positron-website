Catalog Explorer is an experimental feature. Enable [`catalogExplorer.enabled`](positron://settings/catalogExplorer.enabled) in settings and restart Positron.

The Catalog Explorer provides an interface for browsing data in data catalog systems.
Currently, there is support for Snowflake Horizon Catalogs and Databricks Catalogs.
You can explore catalogs, schemas, and tables in a tree view, and copy Python and R code snippets to preview data.

## Add a catalog provider

1. Open the Command Palette with {{< kbd mac=Command-Shift-P win=Ctrl-Shift-P linux=Ctrl-Shift-P >}}
2. Run _Catalogs: Add Catalog Provider_
3. Select your catalog type (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks)
4. Enter your account credentials

For Snowflake connections, the catalog explorer will look for configuration in a [`connections.toml` file](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect#connecting-using-the-connections-toml-file).
The default path is `$SNOWFLAKE_HOME`, but you can configure where this file is saved with the setting [`catalogExplorer.snowflakeConnections`](positron://settings/catalogExplorer.snowflakeConnections).

## Work with tables

The Catalog Explorer differs from the [Connections Pane](connections-pane.qmd) in that it offers a view of many warehouses and tables at once.
It is particularly useful to browse many different tables quickly before connecting to a specific table.
In the Catalog Explorer, right-click on a table to:

- **Preview Table in Active Session**: Load a data preview using the active console 
- **Preview Table with Python**: Copy Python code to access the table and print column names
- **Preview Table with R**: Copy R code to access the table and print column names

## Work with files

Along with support for tables, the Catalog Explorer also supports previewing and downloading files like CSVs.
Right-click on a CSV to:

- **Open With...**: Preview file in the [Data Explorer](data-explorer.qmd)
- **Download File in Active Session**: Download file locally to your machine using the active console
- **Copy Path**: Copy path to file, based on location in your catalog
- **Download File with R**: Download file locally to your machine using an active R console
- **Download File with Python**: Download file locally to your machine using an active Python console

## Remove a catalog provider

Click the trash icon next to a provider name to remove it, or run _Catalogs: Remove Catalog Provider_ from the Command Palette.

## Settings
