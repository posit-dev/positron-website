title: "Completions"
---

Code completions are text suggestions that appear inline as you type in an editor. These suggestions can be lines or blocks of code based on the context of what you're writing. Other names for code completions include inline suggestions, ghost text, or inline completions.

Completions are powered by **GitHub Copilot**. Ensure you've [added GitHub Copilot as a language model provider](assistant-getting-started.qmd#add-github-copilot-as-a-language-model-provider).

## Using code completions

When code completions are available, you'll see ghost text appear in your editor as you type. The ghost text represents the suggested completion.

Interact with suggestions by:

- Pressing the {{< kbd Tab >}} key to accept the entire suggestion.
- Pressing {{< kbd mac=Command-→ win=Ctrl-→ linux=Ctrl-→ >}} to accept the suggestion word-by-word for a single line suggestion, or line-by-line for multi-line suggestions.
- Pressing {{< kbd Esc >}} or continuing to type to dismiss the suggestion.

If you are not receiving suggestions:

- Check if you've enabled inline completions in the settings (see [Settings](#settings) below).
- Check that completions aren't snoozed (paused). If they are, you can either wait for the snooze period to end or cancel the snooze.
- Make sure you are authenticated with GitHub Copilot in the [language model provider configuration](assistant-getting-started.qmd#add-github-copilot-as-a-language-model-provider).
- Refer to the [Troubleshooting](assistant-troubleshooting.qmd) guide for more help.

Note that we do not currently support Next Edit Suggestions (NES) in Positron Assistant.
